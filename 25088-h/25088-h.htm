<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Three hundred years ago Francis Bacon wrote,
amongst other wise words: "To be Master of the
Sea is an Abridgement of Monarchy.... The Bataille of
Actium decided the Empire of the World. The Bataille
of Lepanto arrested the Greatnesse of the Turke. There
be many Examples where Sea-Fights have been Finall to
the Warre. But this much is certaine; that hee that
commands the Sea is at great liberty, and may take as
much and as little of the Warre as he will. Whereas those,
that be strongest by land, are many times neverthelesse
in great Straights. Surely, at this Day, with us of Europe,
the Vantage of Strength at Sea (which is one of the Principall
Dowries of this Kingdome of Greate Brittaine) is
Great; Both because Most of the Kingdomes of Europe
are not merely Inland, but girt with the Sea most part of
their Compasse; and because the Wealth of both Indies
seemes in great Part but an Accessary to the Command
of the Seas."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The three centuries that have gone by since this was
written have afforded ample confirmation of the view here
set forth, as to the importance of "Battailes by Sea" and
the supreme value of the "Command of the Sea." Not
only "we of Europe," but our kindred in America and
our allies in Far Eastern Asia have now their proudly
cherished memories of decisive naval victory.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>
<p>I propose to tell in non-technical and popular language
the story of some of the most remarkable episodes in the
history of sea power. I shall begin with the first sea-fight
of which we have a detailed history&mdash;the Battle of Salamis
(<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 480), the victory by which Themistocles the Athenian
proved the soundness of his maxim that "he who commands
the sea commands all." I shall end with the last
and greatest of naval engagements, the Battle of Tsu-shima,
an event that reversed the long experience of
victory won by West over East, which began with Salamis
more than two thousand years ago. I shall have to tell
of British triumphs on the sea from Sluys to Trafalgar;
but I shall take instances from the history of other countries
also, for it is well that we should remember that the skill,
enterprise, and courage of admirals and seamen is no exclusive
possession of our own people.</p>

<p>I shall incidentally describe the gradual evolution of the
warship from the wooden, oar-driven galleys that fought
in the Straits of Salamis to the steel-built, steam-propelled
giants that met in battle in the Straits of Tsu-shima. I
shall have something to say of old seafaring ways, and
much to tell of the brave deeds done by men of many
nations. These true stories of the sea will, I trust, have
not only the interest that belongs to all records of courage,
danger, and adventure, but also some practical lessons of
their own, for they may help to keep alive that intelligent
popular interest in sea power which is the best guarantee
that the interests of our own navy&mdash;the best safeguard of
the Empire&mdash;will not be neglected, no matter what Government
is in power, or what political views may happen for
the moment to be in the ascendant.</p>

<p class="title big">FROM SALAMIS TO TSU-SHIMA</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="title">
SALAMIS<br />
B.C. 480
</p>


<p>The world has lost all record of the greatest of its
inventors&mdash;the pioneers who in far-off ages devised
the simple appliances with which men tilled the ground,
did their domestic work, and fought their battles for
thousands of years. He who hung up the first weaver's
beam and shaped the first rude shuttle was a more wonderful
inventor than Arkwright. The maker of the first
bow and arrow was a more enterprising pioneer than our
inventors of machine-guns. And greater than the builders
of "Dreadnoughts" were those who "with hearts girt round
with oak and triple brass" were the first to trust their frail
barques to "the cruel sea." No doubt the hollowed tree
trunk, and the coracle of osiers and skins, had long before
this made their trial trips on river and lake. Then came
the first ventures in the shallow sea-margins, and at last
a primitive naval architect built up planked bulwarks
round his hollowed tree trunk, and stiffened them with
ribs of bent branches, and the first ship was launched.</p>

<p>This evolution of the ship must have been in progress
independently in more places than one. We are most
concerned with its development in that eastern end of the
land-locked Mediterranean, which is the meeting-place of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
so many races, and around which so much of what is
most momentous in the world's history has happened.
There seems good reason for believing that among the
pioneers in early naval construction were the men of that
marvellous people of old Egypt to whom the world's
civilization owes so much. They had doubtless learned
their work on their own Nile before they pushed out by
the channels of the Delta to the waters of the "Great Sea."
They had invented the sail, though it was centuries before
any one learned to do more than scud before the wind. It
took long experience of the sea to discover that one could
fix one's sail at an oblique angle with the mid-line of the
ship, and play off rudder against sail to lay a course with
the wind on the quarter or even abeam and not dead astern.</p>

<p>But there was as important an invention as the sail&mdash;that
of the oar. We are so familiar with it, that we do
not realize all it means. Yet it is a notable fact that
whole races of men who navigate river, lake, and sea,
successfully and boldly, never hit upon the principle of
the oar till they were taught it by Europeans, and could
of themselves get no further than the paddle. The oar,
with its leverage, its capacity for making the very weight
of the crew become a motive power, became in more
senses than one the great instrument of progress on the
sea. It gave the ship a power of man&#0339;uvring independently
of the wind, the same power that is the essence of advantage
in steam propulsion. The centuries during which
the sailing ship was the chief reliance of navigation and
commerce were, after all, an episode between the long
ages when the oar-driven galley was the typical ship,
and the present age of steam beginning less than a hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>Sails were an occasional help to the early navigator. Our
songs of the sea call them the "white wings" of the ship.
For the Greek poet &AElig;schylus, the wings of the ship were
the long oars. The trader creeping along the coast or
working from island to island helping himself when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
wind served with his sail, and having only a small crew,
could not afford much oar-power, though he had often
to trust to it. But for the fighting ship, oar-power and
speed were as important as mechanical horse-power is
for the warships of the twentieth century. So the war
galley was built longer than the trader, to make room for
as many oars as possible on either side. In the Mediterranean
in those early days, as with the Vikings of later
centuries, the "Long Ship" meant the ship of war.</p>

<p>It is strange to reflect that all through human history
war has been a greater incentive to shipbuilding progress
than peaceful commerce. For those early navigators the
prizes to be won by fighting and raiding were greater than
any that the more prosaic paths of trade could offer. The
fleets that issued from the Delta of the Nile were piratical
squadrons, that were the terrors of the Mediterranean
coasts. The Greek, too, like the Norseman, began his
career on the sea with piracy. The Athenian historian
tells of days when it was no offence to ask a seafaring
man, "Are you a pirate, sir?" The first Admirals of the
Eastern Mediterranean had undoubtedly more likeness to
Captain Kidd and "Blackbeard" than to Nelson and
Collingwood. Later came the time when organized Governments
in the Greek cities and on the Ph&#0339;nician coast kept
fleets on the land-locked sea to deal with piracy and protect
peaceful commerce. But the prizes that allured the
corsair were so tempting, that piracy revived again and
again, and even in the late days of the Roman Republic
the Consul Pompey had to conduct a maritime war on
a large scale to clear the sea of the pirates.</p>

<p>Of the early naval wars of the Mediterranean&mdash;battles
of more or less piratical fleets, or of the war galleys of
coast and island states&mdash;we have no clear record, or no
vestige of a record. Egyptians, Ph&#0339;nicians, Cretans, men
of the rich island state of which we have only recently
found the remains in buried palaces, Greeks of the Asiatic
mainland, and their Eastern neighbours, Greeks of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
islands and the Peninsula, Illyrians of the labyrinth of
creek and island that fringes the Adriatic, Sicilians and
Carthaginians, all had their adventures and battles on the
sea, in the dim beginnings of history. Homer has his
catalogue of ships set forth in stately verse, telling how
the Greek chieftains led 120,000 warriors embarked on
1100 galleys to the siege of Troy. But no hostile fleet met
them, if indeed the great armament ever sailed, as to
which historians and critics dispute. One must pass on for
centuries after Homer's day to find reliable and detailed
records of early naval war. The first great battle on the
sea, of which we can tell the story, was the fight in the
Straits of Salamis, when Greek and Persian strove for
the mastery of the near East.</p>

<p>King Darius had found that his hold on the Greek
cities of Asia Minor was insecure so long as they could
look for armed help to their kindred beyond the Archipelago,
and he had sent his satraps to raid the Greek
mainland. That first invasion ended disastrously at
Marathon. His son, Xerxes, took up the quarrel and
devoted years to the preparation not of a raid upon Europe,
but of an invasion in which the whole power of his vast
empire was to be put forth by sea and land.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Greece that the man who then
counted for most in the politics of Athens was one who
recognized the all-importance of sea-power, though it is
likely that at the outset all he had in mind was that the
possession of an efficient fleet would enable his city to
exert its influence on the islands and among the coast
cities to the exclusion of the military power of its rival
Sparta. When it was proposed that the product of the
silver mines of Laurium should be distributed among the
Athenian citizens, it was Themistocles who persuaded his
fellow-countrymen that a better investment for the public
wealth would be found in the building and equipment of
a fleet. He used as one of his arguments the probability
that the Persian King would, sooner or later, try to avenge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the defeat of Marathon. A no less effective argument
was the necessity of protecting their growing commerce.
Athens looked upon the sea, and that sea at once divided
and united the scattered Greek communities who lived
on the coasts and islands of the Archipelago. It was the
possession of the fleet thus acquired that enabled Themistocles
and Athens to play a decisive part in the crisis of
the struggle with Asia.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 480 that the march from
Asia Minor began. The vast multitude gathered from
every land in Western Asia, from the shores of the Mediterranean
to the Persian Gulf and the wild mountain plateaux
of the Indian border, was too numerous to be transported
in any fleet that even the Great King could assemble. For
seven days and nights it poured across the floating bridge
that swayed with the current of the Dardanelles, a bridge
that was a wonder of early military engineering, and the
making of which would tax the resources of the best army
of to-day. Then it marched by the coast-line through
what is now Roumelia and Thessaly. It ate up the supplies
of the lands through which it passed. If it was to escape
famine it must keep in touch with the ships that crossed
and recrossed the narrow seas, bringing heavy cargoes of
food and forage from the ports of Asia, and escorted by
squadrons of long war galleys.</p>

<p>Every Greek city had been warned of the impending
danger. Even those who remembered Marathon, the day
when a few thousand spearmen had routed an Asiatic
horde outnumbering them tenfold, realized that any force
that now could be put in the field would be overwhelmed
by this human tide of a million fighting men. But there
was one soldier-statesman who saw the way to safety, and
grasped the central fact of the situation. This was Themistocles
the Athenian, the chief man of that city, against
which the first fury of the attack would be directed. No
doubt it was he who inspired the prophetess of Delphi with
her mysterious message that "the Athenians must make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
for themselves wooden walls," and he supplied the explanation
of the enigma.</p>

<p>The Persian must be met not on the land, but in "wooden
walls" upon the sea. Victory upon that element would
mean the destruction of the huge army on land. The
greater its numbers the more helpless would be its position.
It could not live upon "the country"; there must be a
continual stream of sea-borne supplies arriving from Asia,
and this would be interrupted and cease altogether once
the Greeks were masters of the sea.</p>

<p>The Athens of the time was not the wonderful city
that arose in later years, embellished by the masterpieces
of some of the greatest architects and artists the world
has ever known. The houses huddled round the foot of
the citadel hill&mdash;the Acropolis&mdash;which was crowned with
rudely built primitive temples. But the people whose
home it was were startled by the proposal of Themistocles
that their city should be abandoned to the enemy without
one blow struck in its defence. Not Athens only, but
every village and farm in the surrounding country was to
be deserted. Men, women, and children, horses and cattle,
were all to be conveyed across the narrow strait to the
island of Salamis, which was to be the temporary refuge
of the citizens of Athens and of the country-folk of Attica.</p>

<p>Would they ever return to their ruined homes and
devastated lands, where they would find houses burned,
and vines and olives cut down? Could they even hope to
maintain themselves in Salamis? Would it not be better
to fight in defence of their homes even against desperate
odds and meet their fate at once, instead of only deferring
the evil day? It was no easy task for the man of the
moment to persuade his fellow-countrymen to adopt his
own far-sighted plans. Even when most of them had
accepted his leadership and were obeying his orders, a
handful of desperate men refused to go. They took refuge
on the hill of the Acropolis, and acting upon the literal
meaning of the oracle toiled with axe and hammer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
building up wooden barriers before the gates of the old
citadel.</p>

<p>Everywhere else the city and the country round were
soon deserted. The people streamed down to the shore
and were ferried over to Salamis, where huts of straw and
branches rose up in wide extended camps to shelter the
crowds that could find no place in the island villages. In
every wood on either shore trees were being felled. In
every creek shipwrights were busy night and day building
new ships or refitting old. To every Greek seaport messages
had been sent, begging them to send to the Straits of
Salamis as many ships, oarsmen, and fighting men as they
could muster.</p>

<p>Slowly the Persian army moved southward through
Thessaly. A handful of Spartans, under Leonidas, had
been sent forward to delay the Persian advance. They held
the Pass of Thermopyl&aelig;, between the eastern shoulder of
Mount &AElig;ta and the sea. It was a hopeless position. To
fight there at all with such an insignificant force was a
mistake. But the Government of Sparta, slaves to tradition,
could not grasp the idea of the plans proposed by the
great Athenian. They were half persuaded to recall
Leonidas, but hesitated to act until it was too late. The
Spartan chief and his few hundred warriors died at their
post in self-sacrificing obedience to the letter of their
orders. The Persians poured over the Pass and inundated
the plains of Attica. The few Athenians who had persisted
in defending the Acropolis of Athens made only a brief
resistance against overwhelming numbers. They were
all put to the sword and their fellow-countrymen in the
island of Salamis saw far off the pall of smoke that hung
over their city, where temples and houses alike were sacked
and set on fire by the victors.</p>

<p>The winds and waves had already been fighting for
the Greeks. The Persian war fleet of 1200 great ships
had coasted southwards by the shores of Thessaly till
they neared the group of islands off the northern point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of Eub&#0339;a. Their scouts reported a Greek fleet to be lying
in the channel between the large island and the mainland.
Night was coming on, and the Persians anchored in eight
long lines off Cape Sepias. As the sun rose there came one
of those sudden gales from the eastward that are still the
terror of small craft in the Archipelago. A modern sailor
would try to beat out to seaward and get as far as possible
from the dangerous shore, but these old-world seamen
dreaded the open sea. They tried to ride out the gale, but
anchors dragged and hundreds of ships were piled in
shattered masses on the shore. Some were stranded in
positions where they could be repaired and refloated as
the weather cleared up; but by the evening of the third
day, when at last the wind fell, only eight hundred galleys
of the Persian armada were still in seaworthy fighting
condition.</p>

<p>Here, as on other occasions, the very numbers of the
Persian fleet proved a source of danger to it. The harbours
that could give shelter to this multitude of ships
were very few and far between, nor was it an easy matter
to find that other refuge of the ancient navigator&mdash;a beach
of easy slope and sufficiently wide extent to enable the
ships to be dragged out of the water and placed high and
dry beyond the reach of the angriest waves. The fact that
ships were beached and hauled up the shore during bad
weather, and in winter, limited their size, and in both the
Persian and the Greek fleets there probably was not a ship
much bigger than the barges we see on our canals, or as
big as some of the largest sea-going barges.</p>

<p>The typical warship of the period of the Persian War
was probably not more than eighty or a hundred feet long,
narrow, and nearly flat-bottomed. At the bow and stern
there was a strongly built deck. Between this poop and
forecastle a lighter deck ran fore and aft, and under this
were the stations of the rowers. The bow was strengthened
with plates of iron or brass, and beams of oak, to enable
it to be used as a ram, and the stem rose above the deck
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
level and was carved into the head of some bird or beast.
There was a light mast which could be rigged up when the
wind served, and carried a cross-yard and a square sail.
Mast and yard were taken down before going into action.</p>

<p>The Greeks called their war galleys <i>tri&#x113;res</i>, the Romans
<i>triremes</i>, and these names are generally explained as
meaning that the ships were propelled by three banks or
rows of oars placed one above the other on either side.
The widely accepted theory of how they were worked is
that the seats of the rowers were placed, not directly above
each other, but that those who worked the lowest and
shortest oars were close to the side of the ship, the men
for the middle range of oars a little above them and further
inboard, and the upper tier of rowers still higher and near
the centre-line of the ship. An endless amount of erudition
and research has been expended on this question; but
most of those who have dealt with it have been classical
scholars possessing little or no practical acquaintance with
seafaring conditions, and none of their proposed arrangements
of three banks of oars looks at all likely to be workable
and effective. A practical test of the theory was
made by Napoleon&nbsp;III when his "History of Julius
C&aelig;sar" was being prepared. He had a trireme constructed
and tried upon the Seine. There were three
banks of oars, but though the fitting and arrangement
was changed again and again under the joint advice of
classical experts and practical seamen, no satisfactory
method of working the superposed banks of oars could
be devised.</p>

<p>The probability is that no such method of working was
ever generally employed, and that the belief in the existence
of old-world navies made up of ships with tier on
tier of oars on either side is the outcome of a misunderstanding
as to the meaning of a word. <i>Tri&#x113;res</i> and <i>trireme</i>
seems at first glance to mean triple-oared, in the sense of
the oars being triplicated; but there are strong arguments
for the view that it was not the oars but the oarsmen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
who were arranged in "threes." If this view is correct,
the ancient warship was a galley with a single row of
long oars on either side, and three men pulling together
each heavy oar. We know that in the old navies of the
Papal States and the Republics of Venice and Genoa in the
Middle Ages and the days of the Renaissance, and in
the royal galleys of the old French monarchy, there were
no ships with superposed banks of oars, but there were
galleys known as "triremes," "quadriremes," and "pentaremes,"
driven by long oars each worked by three, four,
or five rowers. It is at least very likely that this was the
method adopted in the warships of still earlier times.</p>

<p>A trireme of the days of the Persian War with fifty or
sixty oars would thus have a crew of 150 or 180 rowers.
Add to this some fifty or sixty fighting men and we have
a total crew of over two hundred. In the Persian navies
the rowers were mostly slaves, like the galley slaves of later
times. They were chained to their oars, and kept in order
or roused to exertion by the whip of their taskmasters.
To train them to work together effectively required a long
apprenticeship, and in rough water their work was especially
difficult. To miss the regular time of the stroke
was dangerous, for the long oars projecting far inboard
would knock down and injure the nearest rowers, unless
all swung accurately together. The flat-bottomed galleys
rolled badly in a heavy sea, and in rough weather rowing
was fatiguing and even perilous work.</p>

<p>Some two hundred men in a small ship meant crowded
quarters, and lack of room everywhere except on the
fighting deck. But as the fleets hugged the shore, and
generally lay up for the night, the crews could mostly land
to cook, eat, and sleep. In the Persian ships belonging
to many nations, and some of them to the Greek cities of
Asia, Xerxes took the precaution of having at least thirty
picked Persian warriors in each crew. Their presence was
intended to secure the fidelity of the rest.</p>

<p>In the Greek fleet the rowers were partly slaves, partly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
freemen impressed or hired for the work. Then there
were a few seamen, fishermen, or men who in the days of
peace manned the local coasting craft. The chiefs of this
navigating party were the <i>keleustes</i>, who presided over the
rowers and gave the signal for each stroke, and the pilot,
who was supposed to have a knowledge of the local waters
and of wind and weather, and who acted as steersman,
handling alone, or with the help of his assistants, the long
stern oar that served as a rudder. The fighting men were
not sailors, but soldiers embarked to fight afloat, and their
military chief commanded the ship, with the help of the
pilot. For more than two thousand years this division
between the sailor and the fighting element in navies continued
throughout the world. The fighting commander
and the sailing-master were two different men, and the
captain of a man-of-war was often a landsman.</p>

<p>In the Greek fleet which lay sheltered in the narrows,
behind the long island of Eub&#0339;a while the Persians were
battling with the tempest off Cape Sepias, the Admiral
was the Spartan Eurybiades, a veteran General, who knew
more about forming a phalanx of spearmen than directing
the movements of a fleet. The military reputation of his
race had secured for him the chief command, though of
the whole fleet of between three and four hundred triremes,
less than a third had been provided by Sparta and her
allies, and half of the armada was formed of the well-equipped
Athenian fleet, commanded by Themistocles in
person. As the storm abated the fleets faced each other
in the strait north of Eub&#0339;a. In the Persian armada the
best ships were five long galleys commanded by an Amazon
queen, Artemisia of Halicarnassus, a Greek fighting against
Greeks. She scored the first success, swooping down with
her squadron on a Greek galley that had ventured to scout
along the Persian front in the grey of the morning. Attacked
by the five the ship was taken, and the victors celebrated
their success by hanging the commander over the prow
of his ship, cutting his throat and letting his blood flow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
into the sea, an offering to the gods of the deep. The
cruel deed was something that inspired no particular sense
of horror in those days of heathen war. It was probably
not on account of this piece of barbarity, but out of their
anger at being opposed by a woman, and a Greek woman,
that the allied leaders of Greece set a price on the head of
the Amazon queen; but no one ever succeeded in qualifying
to claim it.</p>

<p>The Persians, hoping to gain an advantage from their
superior numbers, now detached a squadron which was
to coast along the eastern shores of Eub&#0339;a, enter the strait
at its southern end, and fall on the rear of the Greeks,
while the main body attacked them in front. Eurybiades
and Themistocles had early intelligence of this movement,
but were not alarmed by it. Shortly before sunset the
Greeks bore down on the Persians, attacked them in the
narrow waters where their numbers could not tell, sank
some thirty ships by ramming them, and then drew off as
the night came on.</p>

<p>It was a wild night. The Greeks had hardly regained
their sheltered anchorage when the wind rose, lightning
played round the mountain crests on either hand, the
thunder rolled and the rain came down in torrents. The
main Persian fleet, in a less sheltered position, found it
difficult to avoid disaster, and the crews were horrified at
seeing as the lightning lit up the sea masses of debris and
swollen corpses of drowned men drifting amongst them
as the currents brought the wreckage of the earlier storm
floating down from beyond Cape Sepias. The hundred
ships detached to round the south point of Eub&#0339;a were
still slowly making their way along its rocky eastern coast.
Caught in the midnight storm most of them drove ashore
and were dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>In the morning the sea was still rough, but the Greeks
came out of the strait, and, without committing themselves
to a general action, fell upon the nearest ships, the squadron
of Cilicia, and sank and captured several of them, retiring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
when the main fleet began to close upon them. On the
third day the sea was calm and the Persians tried to force
the narrows by a frontal attack. There was some hard
fighting and loss on both sides, but the Greeks held their
own. As the sun set the Persians rowed back towards their
anchorage inside Cape Sepias.</p>

<p>When the sun rose again the Greek fleet had disappeared.
Eurybiades and Themistocles had agreed in the night after
the battle that the time was come to abandon the defence
of the Eub&#0339;an Strait and retire to the waters of Salamis.
The Persian army was now flooding the mainland with
its myriads of fighting men, and was master of Attica. A
fleet, depending so much on the land for supplies and for
rest for its crews, could not maintain itself in the straits
when the Persians held the mainland and were in a position
to seize also the island of Eub&#0339;a. Before sunrise the
Greek ships were working their way in long procession
through the Strait of Negropont. Early in the day they
began to pass one by one the narrows at Chalcis, now
spanned by a bridge. Then the strait widened, and there
were none to bar their way to the open sea, and round
Cape Sunium to their sheltered station in the straits behind
the island of Salamis.</p>

<p>They had been reinforced on the way, and they now
numbered 366 fighting ships. Those of Sparta and the
Peloponnesus were 89, the Athenian fleet 180, while 97
more were supplied by the Greek islands, some of the
ships from Melos and the Cyclades being penteconters,
large vessels whose long oars were each manned by five
rowers. Losses by storm and battle had reduced the
Persian armada to some six hundred effective ships. The
odds were serious, but not desperate.</p>

<p>But while the Persian fleet was directed by a single will,
there were divided counsels among the Greeks. Eurybiades
had most of the leaders on his side when he argued
that Athens was hopelessly lost, and the best hope for
Greece was to defend the Peloponnesus by holding the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
isthmus of Corinth with what land forces could be assembled
and removing the fleet to the waters of the neighbouring
waters to co-operate in the defence. Themistocles, on the
other hand, shrank from the idea of abandoning the
refugees in the island of Salamis, and he regarded the
adjacent straits as the best position in which the Greeks
could give battle. There, as in the channel of Eub&#0339;a, the
narrow waters would do something to nullify the Persian
advantage of numbers. For the Greeks, formed in several
lines extending from shore to shore, could only be attacked
by equal numbers. Only the leading ships of the attack
would be in action at any given moment, and it would not
matter how many hundred more were crowded behind them.
With a column of spearmen on land the weight of the rearward
ranks, formed in a serried phalanx, would force onward
those in front. But with a column of ships formed in
several successive lines in narrow waters any attempt of the
rearward ships to press forward would mean confusion and
disaster to themselves and those that formed the leading
lines. This would have been true even of ships under sail,
but in battle the war galleys were oar-driven, and as the
ships jammed together there would be entangled oars, and
rowers flung from their benches with broken heads and
arms. Better discipline, more thorough fighting-power on
the Greek side, would mean that the leading ships of their
fleet would deal effectually with their nearest adversaries,
while the rearward ships would rest upon their oars and
plunge into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e only where disaster to a leading ship
left an opening.</p>

<p>A doubtful story says that Themistocles, foreseeing that
if the battle was long delayed the Spartan party would
carry their point and withdraw to the isthmus, ran the
risk of sending a message to King Xerxes, urging him to
attack at once, hinting at a defection of the Athenian fleet,
and telling him that if he acted without delay the Greeks
were at his mercy, and that they were so terrified that
they were thinking chiefly of how they might escape.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Herodotus tells of a council of war of the Persian leaders at
which the fighting Queen Artemisia stood alone in advising
delay. She told the King that in overrunning northern
Greece he had done enough for one campaign. Let him
settle down for winter quarters in Attica and he would see
the Greek armament, already divided by jealousies and
quarrels, break up and disperse. He could then prepare
quietly for the conquest of the Peloponnesus in the spring.
But Xerxes was more flattered by the opinion of the
satraps who told him that he had only to stretch out his
hands to destroy the Greek fleet and make himself undisputed
master of the sea. And, just as Themistocles
was despairing of being able to keep the fleet at Salamis,
news came that the Persians had decided to attack. The
news was brought by Aristides, the son of Lysimachus,
who had been unjustly exiled from Athens some years
before, but now in the moment of his country's danger
ran the blockade of the Persians in a ship of &AElig;gina, and
came to throw in his lot with his fellow-citizens. For
the Greeks to set out for the isthmus under these circumstances
would be to risk having to meet superior numbers
in the open sea. All now agreed that the fate of Greece
was to be decided in the waters of Salamis.</p>

<p>Xerxes looked forward to the coming struggle with
assured hope of victory, and prepared to enjoy the spectacle
of the disaster that was about to fall upon his enemies.</p>

<p>On the green slope of Mount &AElig;galeos, which commanded
a full view of Salamis and the straits, the silken tents of
the King and his Court were erected, a camp that was like
a palace. Purple-dyed hangings, gilded tent poles with
pomegranates of pure gold at the top of each, carpets
bright with colour, carved furniture inlaid with ivory, all
made up a display of luxurious pomp. Before the royal
tents a golden throne had been erected. Fan-bearers took
their post on either side, nobles who held the office of sword-bearers
and cup-bearers waited at the steps of the throne.
On either side and on the slope below the ranks of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
"Immortal Guard" were formed, ten thousand veterans,
with armour and equipments gleaming with silver and gold.
Along the shore from the white marble cliffs of Sunium by
the port of Phalerum and far up the winding coast-line of
the straits, hundreds of thousands more of this army of
many nations stood in battle array. They were to witness
the destruction of the Great King's enemies, and to take an
active part in it when, as all expected, disabled Greek
galleys would be driven ashore, and their crews would ask
in vain for quarter. They were to share, too, in the irruption
into Salamis once the fleet was master of the straits,
and when the people of Athens, no longer protected by
the sea, would be at the mercy of the Asiatic warriors.</p>

<p>Amid the blare of trumpets the King took his seat upon
his throne, and watched his great armada sweeping towards
the straits like a floating city. In those hundreds of long,
low-sided ships thousands of slaves strained at the banks
of heavy oars, encouraged by the shouts of the picked
warriors who crowded the decks, and if their energies
flagged, stimulated to new exertions by the whip of their
taskmasters.</p>

<p>From every point of vantage in Salamis, women, old
men, children, all who could not fight, looked out upon
the sea, watching with heart-rending anxiety the signs of
the approaching struggle. Death or slavery and untold
misery would be their fate if numbers should prevail in the
battle. In our days, in the hours before such a decisive
struggle a people watches the newspapers, and waits for
tidings of the fight in a turmoil of mingled hopes and fears.
But whatever may be the result the individual, who is
thus a spectator at a distance, runs no personal risks.
It was otherwise in those days of merciless heathen warfare,
and here all would see for themselves the changing
fortunes of the fight on which their own fate depended.</p>

<p>The Greek fleet had been formed in two divisions of unequal
strength. The smaller anchored in the western
opening of the straits, furthest from the advance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
enemy's armada, and was detailed to prevent any attack
through the narrows on the Greek rear. The main body,
three hundred strong, was moored in successive lines, just
inside the opening of the straits to the eastward. The best
ships, the most trusted leaders, the picked warriors were in
the foremost line. On them the result of the day would
chiefly depend, and here the man who had planned it all,
commanded an Athenian war galley in the centre of the
array. In this fact we see another striking difference
between past and present. The modern specialization of
offices and capacities which divides between different
individuals the functions of political leader, general, and
admiral was yet centuries distant in the future. Themistocles,
who had advised the policy of naval war, was
to be the foremost leader in the battle, and though purely
naval tactics were to have some part in it, it was to be to
a great extent a land battle fought out on floating platforms,
so that one who had learned the art of war on land could
act as an admiral on the sea.</p>

<p>Sixty thousand men-rowers and warriors were crowded on
board the Greek fleet. At least twice as many must have
been borne on the decks and rowers' benches of the Persian
armada. Midway in the opening of the straits the Persians
had occupied the rocky island of Psytalia. Its ledges and
its summit glittered with arms, and beside it some light
craft had taken post to assist friendly vessels in distress.
Past the islet the great fleet swept in four successive divisions
driven by the measured stroke of tens of thousands
of oars. On the left of the leading line was the Ph&#0339;nician
fleet led by the tributary kings of Tyre and Sidon, a
formidable squadron, for these war galleys were manned
by real seamen, bold sailors who knew not only the ways
of the land-locked Mediterranean, but had ventured into
the outer ocean. On the right were the ships of the Greek
cities of Ionia, the long galleys of Ephesus, Miletus, Samos,
and Samothrace. Here Greek would meet Greek in deadly
strife. The rowers shouted as they bent to the long oars.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
The warriors grouped in the prow with spear and javelin
in hand sang the war songs of many nations. Along the
bulwarks of the ships of Asia crouched the Persian and
Babylonian archers, the best bowmen of the ancient
world, with the arrow resting ready on the string. As
the left of the leading line reached the opening of the
strait the rowers reduced their speed, while on the other
flank the stroke became more rapid. The long line was
wheeling round the point of Salamis, and came in full sight
of the Greek fleet ranged in battle array across the narrows.</p>

<p>The Athenian ships formed the right and centre of its
leading line, the fleet of the Peloponnesus under the veteran
Eurybiades was on the left. The rowers were resting on
their oars, or just using them enough to keep the ships in
position. As the Persians came sweeping into the straits
the Greeks began to chant the P&aelig;an, their battle hymn.
The crash of the encounter between the two navies was
now imminent.</p>

<p>For a few moments it seemed that already the Persians
were assured of victory, for, seeing the enormous mass of
the ships of Asia crowding the strait from shore to shore,
and stretching far away on the open sea outside it, not a
few of the European leaders lost heart for a while. The
rowers began to backwater, and many of the ships of the
first line retired stern foremost into the narrows. The
rest followed their example, each one fearing to lose his
place in the line, and be exposed in isolation to the attack
of a crowd of enemies. It was perilously like the beginning
of a panic that would soon end in disaster if it
were not checked.</p>

<p>But it was soon over. The last of the retiring Greek
ships was a galley of Pallene in Macedonia, commanded
by a good soldier, Arminias. He was one of those who
was doing his best to check the panic. Resolved that whoever
else gave way he would sink rather than take to flight,
he turned the prow of his trireme against the approaching
enemy, and evading the ram of a Persian ship ran alongside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of her. The intermingled oars broke like matchwood, and
the two ships grappled. The battle had begun. Attacked
on the other side by another of the ships of Asia, Arminias
was in deadly peril. The sight of their comrade's courage
and of his danger stopped the retirement of the Greeks.
Their rowers were now straining every nerve to come to
the rescue of the isolated trireme, and from shore to shore
the two fleets met with loud outcry and the jarring crash
of scores of voluntary or involuntary collisions.</p>

<p>All order was soon lost. The strait of Salamis was now
the scene of a vast m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, hundreds of ships crowding
together in the narrow pass between the island and the
mainland. Themistocles in the centre with the picked
ships of Athens was forcing his way, wedge-like, between
the Ph&#0339;nician and Ionian squadrons into the dense mass
of the Persian centre. The bronze beaks ground their
way into hostile timbers, oars were swept away, rowers
thrown in confusion from their benches stunned and with
broken limbs. Ships sank and drowning men struggled for
life; the Asiatic archers shot their arrows at close quarters,
the spearmen hurled their javelins; but it was not by
missile weapons the fight was to be decided. Where the
stroke of the ram failed, the ships were jammed together
in the press, and men fought hand to hand on forecastles
and upper decks. Here it was that the Greeks, trained
athletes, chosen men in the prime of life, protected by their
armour and relying on the thrust of the long and heavy
spear, had the advantage over the Asiatics. Only their
own countrymen of the Ionian squadron could make any
stand against them, and the Ionians had to face the spears
of Sparta, in the hands of warriors all eager to avenge the
slaughter of Thermopyl&aelig;.</p>

<p>Some of these Ionian Greeks, fighting under the Persian
standard, won local successes here and there in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.
They captured or sank several of the Spartan triremes.
One of the ships of Samothrace performed an exploit like
that of Paul Jones, when with his own ship sinking under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the feet of his crew he boarded and captured the "Serapis."
A Greek trireme had rammed the Samothracian ship, tearing
open her side; but as she went down her Persian and
Ionian crew scrambled on board their assailant and drove
the Greeks into the sea at the spear-point. It was noted
that few of the Persian crews were swimmers. When their
ships sank they were drowned. The Greeks were able to
save themselves in such a disaster. They threw away
shield, helmet, and spear, and swam to another ship or to
the island shore.</p>

<p>This fact would seem to indicate that with the exception
of those who manned the Ionian and Ph&#0339;nician squadrons
the crews of the Persian fleet were much less at home on
the sea than the Greeks. And we know from the result
of many battles, from Marathon to the victories of Alexander,
that on land the Greek was a better fighting man than
the Asiatic. The soldiers of the "Great King," inferior
in fighting-power even on the land, would therefore find
themselves doubly handicapped by having to fight on the
narrow platforms floating on an unfamiliar element, and
the sight of ships being sunk and their crews drowned
would tend to produce panic among them. So the Greek
wedge forced itself further and further into the mass of
hostile ships, and in the narrow waters numbers could not
tell. The Greeks were never at any given moment engaged
with a superior force in actual hand-to-hand conflict,
and they had sufficient ships behind them to make
good any local losses. Such a battle could have only one
result.</p>

<p>All order had been lost in the Persian fleet at an early
stage of the fight. The rearward squadrons had pressed
into the strait, and finding that in the crowded waters they
were endangering each other without being able to take
any effective part in the battle they began to draw off,
and the foremost ships, pressed back by the Greek attack,
began to follow them towards the open water. The whole
mingled mass of the battle was drifting eastward. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
movement left the island of Psytalia unprotected by the
Asiatic fleet, and Aristides, the Athenian, who had been
watching the fight from the shore of Salamis, embarked
a force of spearmen on some light vessels, ferried them
across to Psytalia and attacked its Persian garrison. They
made a poor show of resistance, and to a man they were
speared or flung over the rocks into the sea. The poet
&AElig;schylus, who was fighting as a soldier on one of the
Athenian triremes, told afterwards, not in pity, but rejoicing
at the destruction of his country's enemies, how
the cries of the massacred garrison of Psytalia were heard
above the din of the battle and increased the growing
panic of the Persians.</p>

<p>Even those who had fought best in the Asiatic armada
were now losing heart and taking to flight. Queen Artemisia,
with her five galleys of Halicarnassus, had fought
in the front line among the ships of the Ionian squadron.
She was now working her way out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and in the
confusion rammed and sank a Persian warship. Xerxes,
watching the fight from his throne on the hillside, thought
it was a Greek ship that the Amazon had destroyed and
exclaimed: "This woman is playing the man while my
men are acting like women!"</p>

<p>Two Persian ships in flight from the pursuing Greeks
drove ashore at the base of Mount &AElig;galeos. Xerxes, in
his anger at the disaster to his fleet, ordered the troops
stationed on the beach to behead every officer and man
of their crews, and the sentence was at once executed. The
closing scene of the battle was, indeed, a time of unmitigated
horrors, for while this massacre of the defeated crews
was being carried out by the Persian guardsmen, the
victorious Greeks were slaying all the fugitives who fell
into their hands. The Admiral of the Persian fleet, Ariabignes,
brother of Xerxes, was among the dead.</p>

<p>The pursuit was not continued far beyond the straits.
The Greeks hesitated to venture into open waters where
numbers might tell against them if the Persians rallied,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and they drew back to their morning anchorage. The
remnant of the Persian fleet anchored off the coast near
Phalerum, the port of Athens, or took refuge in the small
harbour. They were rejoined by a detachment which had
been sent to round the south side of Salamis to attack the
western entrance of the straits, but which for some reason
had never been engaged during the day.</p>

<p>The victorious Greeks did not realize the full extent of
their triumph. They expected to be attacked again next
morning, and hoped to repeat the man&#0339;uvre which had
been so far successful, of engaging the enemy in the narrows
with each flank protected by the shore, and no room for a
superior force to form in the actual line of fighting contact.
But though they did not yet realize the fact, they had won
a decisive victory. Xerxes had been so impressed by the
failure of his great armada to force the narrows of Salamis
that he had changed all his plans.</p>

<p>In the night after the battle he held a council of war.
It was decided that the attack should not be renewed, for
there was no prospect of a second attempt giving better
results. Artemisia was directed to convey Prince Artaxerxes,
the heir of the Empire, back to Asia. Xerxes himself
would lead back to the bridge of the Hellespont the
main body of his immense army, for to attempt to maintain
it in Greece during the winter would have meant famine
in its camps. The fleet was to sail at once for the northern
Archipelago, and limit its operations to guarding the
bridge of the Hellespont and protecting the convoys for
the army. When the winter came it would have to be
laid up; but by that time it was hoped Xerxes and the
main body would be safe in Asia. Mardonius, the most
trusted of his satraps, was to occupy northern Greece with
a picked force of 300,000 men, with which he was to
attempt the conquest of the Peloponnesus next year.</p>

<p>The Persian fleet sailed from the roadstead of Phalerum
during that same night. How far the crews were demoralized
by the defeat of the previous day is shown by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the fact that there was something of a panic as the white
cliffs of Sunium glimmered through the darkness in the
moonlight and were mistaken for the sails of hostile Greek
warships menacing the line of retreat. The Persians stood
far out to sea to avoid these imaginary enemies. When
the day broke Themistocles and Eurybiades could hardly
credit the report that all the ships of Asia had disappeared
from their anchorage of the evening before. The Athenian
admiral urged immediate pursuit, the Spartan general
hesitated and at last gave a reluctant consent. The fleet
sailed as far as the island of Andros, but found no trace
of the enemy. In vain Themistocles urged that it should
go further, and if it failed to find the enemy's fleet, at least
show itself in the harbours of Asia and try to rouse Ionia
to revolt. Eurybiades declared that enough had been
accomplished, and refused to risk a voyage across the
Archipelago in the late autumn. So the victorious fleet
returned to Salamis, and thence the various contingents
dispersed to be laid up for the winter in sheltered harbours
and on level beaches, where a stockade could be erected
and a guard left to protect the ships till the fine weather
of next spring allowed them to be launched again.</p>

<p>When Xerxes reached the Hellespont with his army,
after having lost heavily by disease and famine in his
weary march through Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, he
found that the long bridge with which he had linked together
Europe and Asia had been swept away by a storm. But
the remnant of his fleet was there waiting to ferry across
the strait what was left of his army, now diminished by
many hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>The next year witnessed the destruction both of the
army left under Mardonius in northern Greece and of the
remainder of the Persian fleet that had fought at Salamis.
Pausanias, with a hundred thousand Greeks, routed the
Persian army at <span class="ins" title="Platea">Plat&aelig;a</span>. A fleet of 110 triremes, under
the admirals <span class="ins" title="Leothychides">Leotychides</span> and Xantippus, sailed across
the Archipelago in search of the Persian fleet. They found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
it in the waters of Samos, but the enemy retired towards
the mainland without giving battle. The Asiatics were
disheartened and divided. The Ionians were suspected of
disaffection. The Ph&#0339;nicians were anxious only to return
in safety to their own country and resume their peaceful
trading, and as soon as they were out of sight of the
Greeks, they deserted the Persian fleet, and sailed southwards,
bound for Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<p>What was left of the fleet anchored under the headland
of Mycale. There was no sign of a Greek pursuit. Rumour
reported that the Athenian and Spartan admirals were
intent only on securing possession of the islands, and
would not venture on any enterprise against the coast of
Asia. Perhaps it was because he still feared to risk another
engagement on the sea, that the Persian admiral found a
pretext for laying up his ships. He declared that they
were so foul with weeds and barnacles that, as a prelude
to any further operations, they must be beached and
cleaned. They were therefore hauled ashore under the
headland, and a stockade was erected round them, the
fleet thus becoming a fortified camp guarded by its crews.</p>

<p>And then the dreaded Greek fleet appeared. Its hundred
triremes could disembark some twenty thousand men, for
arms were provided even for the rowers. A landing from
low-sided ships of light draught was an easy matter. They
were driven in a long line towards the shore. As they
grounded, the warriors sprang into the water and waded
to land. The rowers left their oars, grasped spear or sword,
and followed them. The stockade was stormed; the
ships inside it, dry with the heat of the Asiatic sun, and
with seams oozing with tar, were set on fire and were soon
burning fiercely. As the flames died down and the pall
of smoke drifted far over the promontory of Mycale, a
mass of charred timbers was all that was left of the great
armada of Asia, and the victorious Greeks sailed homewards
with the news that the full fruits of Salamis had
been garnered.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="title">
ACTIUM<br />
B.C. 31</p>


<p>Actium was one of the decisive battles of the world&mdash;the
event that fixed the destinies of the Roman Empire
for centuries to come, made Octavian its dictator, and
enabled him, while keeping the mere forms of Republican
life, to inaugurate the imperial system of absolute rule,
and reign as the first of the Roman Emperors, under the
name and title of Augustus.</p>

<p>It brought to a close the series of civil wars which
followed the murder of his grand-uncle, Julius C&aelig;sar.
The triumvirs, Mark Antony, Octavian, and Lepidus, had
avenged the assassination by a wholesale proscription of
their political opponents, all of whom indiscriminately they
charged with the guilt of the deed; and had defeated
Brutus and Cassius on the plains of Philippi. They had
parcelled out the Empire among them, and then quarrelled
over the spoil. Octavian, the dictator of the West, had
expelled Lepidus from the African provinces that had
been assigned to him as his territory. Antony was now
his only remaining rival. C&aelig;sar's veteran lieutenant held
the Eastern provinces of the Empire. During the years
he had spent in the East he had become half Orientalized,
under the influence of the famous Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra,
for whose sake he had dismissed his wife Octavia,
the sister of Octavian, in order that the Egyptian might
take her place. He had appeared beside her in Alexandria
wearing the insignia of the Egyptian god Osiris, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Cleopatra wore those of Isis. Coins and medals were struck
bearing their effigies as joint rulers of the East, and the
loyalty of Rome and the West to Octavian was confirmed
by the sense of indignation which every patriotic Roman
felt at the news that Antony spoke openly of making
Alexandria and not Rome the centre of the Empire, and
of founding with the Egyptian Queen a new dynasty that
would rule East and West from the Nile.</p>

<p>The question to be decided in the civil war was therefore
not merely whether Octavian or Antony was to be the
ruler of the Roman world, but whether Eastern or Western
influences were to predominate in shaping its destinies.
Antony was preparing to carry the war into Italy, and
assembled on the western shores of Greece an army made
up of the Roman legions of the eastern provinces and large
contingents of Oriental allies. During the winter of
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 32&ndash;31, he had his head-quarters at Patr&aelig; (now Patras),
on the Gulf of Corinth, and his army, scattered in detachments
among the coast towns, was kept supplied with
grain by ships from Alexandria. Antony's war fleet,
strengthened by squadrons of Ph&#0339;nician and Egyptian
galleys, lay safely in the land-locked Ambracian Gulf
(now the Gulf of Arta), approached by a winding strait
that could easily be defended.</p>

<p>But Octavian had determined to preserve Italy from
the horrors of war, by transporting an army across the
Adriatic in the coming summer and deciding the conflict
on the shores of Greece. An army of many legions was
already in cantonments on the eastern coast of Italy, or
prepared to concentrate there in the spring. His fleet
crowded the ports of Tarentum (Taranto) and Brundusium
(Brindisi), and minor detachments were wintering in the
smaller harbours of southern Italy. Most of his ships
were smaller than those to which they were to be opposed.
It was reported that Antony had a considerable number
of huge quinqueremes, and even larger ships of war, anchored
in the Ambracian Gulf. The ships of the Western Empire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
were mostly triremes; but there was the advantage that
while Antony's fleet was largely manned by hastily recruited
landsmen, Octavian had crews made up of experienced
sailors. Many of them were of the race of the
Liburni, men of the island-fringed coast of Dalmatia,
to this day among the best sailors of the Adriatic,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and his admiral was the celebrated Marcus Vipsanius
Agrippa, who had to his credit more than one naval success
in the civil wars, amongst them a victory won off the
headland of Myl&aelig;, in the same waters that had been the
scene of the triumph of Duilius.</p>

<p>Early in the spring, while the main body of Octavian's
fleet concentrated at Brundusium, and the army that was
to cross the Adriatic gathered around the harbour, Agrippa
with a strong squadron put to sea, seized the port of
Methone in the Peloponnesus, and using this place as his
base of operations captured numbers of the Egyptian
transports that were conveying supplies to the enemy's
camps. Antony ought to have replied to this challenge by
putting to sea with his combined fleet, forcing Agrippa
to concentrate the Western armament to meet him, and
deciding by a pitched battle who was to have the command
of the sea in the Adriatic. But C&aelig;sar's old lieutenant,
once as energetic and enterprising a soldier as his
master, had now become indolent and irresolute. He was
used to idling away weeks and months with Cleopatra and
his semi-Oriental Court. Instead of venturing on a vigorous
offensive campaign he left the initiative to his opponent,
and with a nominally more powerful fleet at his disposal
he passively abandoned the command of the sea to Agrippa
and Octavian.</p>

<p>The Egypto-Roman army was ordered to concentrate
on the southern shores of the Ambracian Gulf. A division
of the fleet was moored in the winding strait at its entrance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
but directed to act only on the defensive. Inside the Gulf
the rest of the fleet lay, the largest ships at anchor, the
smaller hauled up on the shore.</p>

<p>The crews had been brought up to full strength by
enlisting mule-drivers, field-labourers, and other inexperienced
landsmen, and would have been better for
training at sea; but except for some drills on the landlocked
waters they were left in idleness, and sickness soon
broke out among them and thinned their numbers. The
ships thus inefficiently manned presented a formidable
array. There were some five hundred in all, including,
however, a number of large merchantmen hastily fitted
for war service. Just as modern men-of-war are provided
with steel nets hanging on booms as a defence against
torpedoes, so it would seem that some at least of Antony's
ships had been fitted with a clumsy device for defending
them against attack by ramming. Below the level of the
oars, balks of timber were propped out from their sides
at the water-line, and it was hoped that these barricades
would break the full force of an enemy's "beak." But
the invention had the drawback of diminishing the speed
of the ship, and making quick turning more difficult, and
thus it increased the very danger it was intended to avert.</p>

<p>Another feature of the larger ships, some of them the
biggest that had yet been built for the line of battle, the
"Dreadnoughts" of their day, was that wooden castles or
towers had been erected on their upper decks, and on these
structures were mounted various specimens of a rude
primitive substitute for artillery, ballist&aelig;, catapults, and
the like, engines for discharging by mechanical means
huge darts or heavy stones. These same towers were also
to be the places from which the Eastern bowmen, the best
archers of the ancient world, would shower their arrows on
a hostile fleet.</p>

<p>But locked up in the bottle-necked Ambracian Gulf the
great fleet, with its tower-crowned array of floating giants,
had as little effect on the opening phase of the campaign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
as if its units had been so many castles on the shore.
Agrippa soon felt that there was no serious risk of any
attempt being made by Antony to interrupt the long
and delicate operation of ferrying over an army of a
hundred thousand men and some twelve thousand cavalry
from Italy to the opposite shore of the Adriatic. He took
the precaution of watching the outlet of the Ambracian
Gulf with his swiftest ships. The narrow entrance, while
making it difficult to force a way into the Gulf, had the
disadvantage of all such positions, that a large fleet would
take a considerable time to issue from it into the open sea,
and it was therefore comparatively easy to blockade and
observe it. If Antony showed any sign of coming out,
there would be time to bring up the whole fleet of Octavian
to meet him in the open.</p>

<p>It was thus that Octavian was able securely to embark
his army in successive divisions, and land it without
interruption at the port of Toryne on the eastern coast
of the Adriatic. Having assembled there, it marched
southwards along the coast till it reached the hills on the
northern shore of the Ambracian Gulf, and the two armies
and fleets were in presence of each other.</p>

<p>The legions of Octavian encamped on a rising ground
a few miles north of the entrance of the Gulf, and above
a narrow neck of land which divided one of its inlets from
the open sea. The coast is here hollowed into a wide bay, in
which the main body of Agrippa's fleet was anchored, while
a detached squadron observed the opening of the straits.
The camp was surrounded by entrenchments, and connected
with the station of the fleet by a road protected by lines of
earthworks and palisades, for it was the custom of the
Romans to make as much use of pick and spade as of
sword and spear in their campaigns. On the site of the
camp Octavian afterwards founded Nicopolis, "the City
of Victory," as the memorial of his triumph.</p>

<p>From the camp on the hill there was a wide view over
the Ambracian Gulf, a sheet of water some thirty miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
long and ten wide, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills
sloping to flat, and in many places marshy, shores. On
the wide waters the fleet of Antony lay moored, line behind
line, a forest of masts and yards. In the narrows of the
entrance some of his largest ships were anchored. Many
of the ships of Ph&#0339;nicia and Egypt displayed an Eastern
profusion of colour in their painted upper works, their
gilded bows, and their bright flags and streamers. Near
the southern shore lay the state galley of Cleopatra, a
floating palace, with its silken sails, gilded bulwarks, and
oars bound and plated with silver.</p>

<p>A line of earthworks and forts across the neck of the
northern point, garrisoned by the best of Antony's Roman
veterans, defended one side of the narrows. The other
side was a low-lying, triangular stretch of land, dry, sandy
ground. The Greeks knew it as the <i>Akte</i>, just as the Italian
sailors still call it the <i>Punta</i>, both words having the same
meaning, "the Point." At its northern extremity on a
rocky platform there rose a temple of Apollo, known as
the "Aktion," the "sanctuary of the point," a place of
pilgrimage for the fisher and sailor folk of the neighbourhood.
Its name, Latinized into <i>Actium</i>, became famous
as that of the naval battle.</p>

<p>On the level ground by the temple was the camp of the
army of Antony and Cleopatra, a city of tents and reed-built
huts, within its midst the gay pavilions of the Court.
It was a mixed gathering of many nations&mdash;Roman legions
commanded by veterans of the wars of C&aelig;sar; Egyptian
battalions in the quaint war dress we see on the painted
walls of tombs by the Nile, and the semi-barbarous levies
of the tributary kings of Eastern Asia. There were widespread
dissension and mutual suspicion among the allies.
Not a few of the Romans were chafing at their leader's
subservience to a "Barbarian" queen. Many of the
Eastern kinglets were considering whether they could not
make a better bargain with Octavian. The cavalry of both
armies skirmished among the hills on the land side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Gulf, and prisoners made by Octavian's troops readily
took service with them. Then one of the Asiatic kings,
instead of fighting, joined the hostile cavalry with his
barbaric horsemen, and night after night Roman deserters
stole into the camp of Octavian on the northern height.</p>

<p>An attempt led by Antony in person against the Roman
entrenchments was beaten off. A detachment of the fleet
tried to elude the vigilance of Agrippa and slip out to sea,
but had to retire before superior numbers. Then both
parties watched each other, while at the head-quarters of
Antony councils of war were held to debate upon a plan
of campaign. The situation was becoming difficult. For
Octavian contented himself with holding his fortified
camp with his infantry, drawing his supplies freely from
over-sea, while his cavalry prevented anything reaching
Antony's lines from the land side, and Agrippa's fleet
blockading the Gulf and sweeping the sea, made it impossible
to bring corn from Egypt. Provisions were
running short, and sickness was rife. A move of some kind
must be made.</p>

<p>The veteran Canidius, who commanded the army under
Antony, had like most of the Romans little faith in the
efficiency of the fleet. He proposed to Antony that it
should be abandoned, and that the army should march
eastward into Macedonia, and, with an unexhausted
country to supply it, await the pursuit of ten legions of
Octavian in a favourable position. But Antony, influenced
by Cleopatra, refused to desert the fleet, which was the
one possible hope of reaching Egypt again, and rejecting
an attack on the Roman entrenchments as a hopeless
enterprise, he decided at last that all the treasure of
Court and army should be embarked on the ships, and an
effort made to break through the blockading squadrons.</p>

<p>While the preparations were being made, the Romans
renewed their entreaties that their leader would rather
stake his fortunes on a battle on land. One day a veteran
centurion of his guard, who bore the honourable scars of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
many campaigns, addressing him with tears in his eyes, said
to Antony: "Imperator, why distrust these wounds, this
sword? Why put your hopes on wretched logs of wood?
Let Ph&#0339;nicians and Egyptians fight on the sea, but let us
have land on which we know how to conquer or die." It
is the appeal that Shakespeare puts into the mouth of one
of Antony's soldiers:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The sight of the Egypto-Roman fleet crowding down
to the narrows with their sails bent on their yards showed
that they meant to risk putting to sea, and Octavian embarked
on Agrippa's fleet, with picked reinforcements from
the legions. For four days the wind blew strongly from
the south-west and the blockaded fleet waited for better
weather. On the fifth day the wind had fallen, the sea
was smooth and the sun shone brightly. The floating
castles of Antony's van division worked out of the straits,
and after them in long procession came the rest of the
Roman, Ph&#0339;nician, and Egyptian galleys.</p>

<p>From the hills to the northward of the straits, from the
low-lying headland of Actium to the south, two armies,
each of a hundred thousand men, watched the spectacle,
and waited anxiously for the sight of the coming battle.</p>

<p>The Western fleet had steered to a position off the
entrance formed in two divisions, the one led by Agrippa,
the other by Octavian. Agrippa, whose experience and
record of naval victory gave him the executive command,
had no intention of risking his small ships in the narrows,
where they would have been opposed by an equal number
of heavier ships, more numerously manned, and would lose
whatever advantage their superior handiness and seaworthiness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
gave them, through having no room to
man&#0339;uvre. He kept his fleet of four hundred triremes
sufficiently far from the shore to avoid the shelving shallows
that fringe it near the entrance to the straits, and to have
ample sea-room.</p>

<p>For some time the fleets remained in presence of each
other, both hesitating to begin the attack. Antony knew
that his slower and heavier ships would have the best
chance acting inshore and on the defensive, and Agrippa
was, on the other hand, anxious not to engage until he
could lure them out seaward, where his light craft would
have all the gain of rapid man&#0339;uvring.</p>

<p>It was not till near noon that at last the Western fleet
closed with the Allies. The ships that first encountered
were nearly all Roman vessels, for the Egyptian and Asiatic
squadrons were not in the front line of Antony's fleet, and
the brunt of the attack fell upon the sluggish giants that
had been so elaborately fortified with booms in the water and
towers and breastworks on their decks. As the attacking
ships came into range, arrows, javelins, and stones flew
hurtling through the air from the line of floating castles,
missiles that did not, however, inflict much loss, for the
men on the decks of the attacking fleet crouched behind
bulwarks or covered themselves with their oblong shields,
and their bowmen made some show of reply to the heavier
discharge of engines of war on Antony's ships and to the
more rapid shooting of the Asiatic archers. The days
were still far off when sea fights would be decided by
"fire," in the sense of the discharge of projectiles.</p>

<p>Could the tall ships have rammed the smaller and lower
galleys of Octavian and Agrippa they would certainly
have sent them to the bottom&mdash;a sunken ship for each
blow of the brazen beak. But attempts at ramming were
soon found by Antony's captains to be both useless and
dangerous. It was not merely that their lighter and nimbler
opponents easily avoided the onset. The well-trained
crews evaded every attempt to run them down or grapple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
them, chose their own distance as they hovered round
their huge adversaries, and presently as they gained confidence
from impunity, began successfully to practise the
man&#0339;uvre of eluding the ram, and using their own bows,
not for a blow against the hull of the heavier ship, but to
sweep away and shatter her long oars, that were too heavy
to be saved by drawing them in or unshipping them.
Successful attack on the oars was equivalent to disabling
an adversary's engines in a modern sea-fight. And when
a ship was thus crippled, her opponents could choose their
own time to concentrate several of their ships for a joint
attempt to take her by boarding.</p>

<p>The unwieldy ships of Antony's first line, with their
half-trained and untrained crews, must have formed a
straggling irregular line with large intervals as they stood
out to sea, and it was this that gave Octavian's fleet the
opportunity for the worrying tactics they adopted. Had
the Egyptian and Ph&#0339;nician ships come to the support
of the leading line, their more sailor-like crews might have
helped to turn the scale against Octavian. But while the
fight was yet undecided and before the Egyptian squadron
had taken any part in it, a breeze sprang up from the land,
blowing from the north-east. Then, to the dismay of
Antony's veterans who watched the battle from the headland
of Actium, it was seen that the Egyptians were unfurling
their sails from the long yards. The signal had
been given from Cleopatra's stately vessel, which as the
battle began had rowed out to a position in the midst of
the Egyptian squadron, and now shook out her purple sails
to the breeze, silken fabrics of fiery red, that seemed at
first glance like a battle-signal. But in battle sails were
never used and ships trusted entirely to the oar, so to set
the sails meant plainly that the fight was to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Driven by her silver-tipped oars, helped now with the
land breeze that swelled her sails, Cleopatra's galley passed
astern of the fighting-line on its extreme left, and sixty
of the warships of Alexandria followed their queen. Those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
who watched from the land must have hoped against hope
that this was a novel man&#0339;uvre, to use the breeze to aid
the squadron of their allies to shoot out from behind the
main body, gain the flank of the enemy, and then suddenly
let the sails flap idly, furl or drop them, and sweep down
with full speed of oars on the rear of the attack, with
Cleopatra leading like Artemisia at Salamis. But the
"serpent of old Nile" had no such ideas. She was
in full flight for Alexandria, with her warships escorting
her and conveying the wealth that had been embarked
when it was decided to put to sea. Was her flight an act
of treachery, or the result of panic-stricken alarm at the
sight of the battle? But even her enemies never accused
her of any lack of personal courage, and there are many
indications that it had been arranged before the fleet came
out, that, as soon as an opportunity offered, Cleopatra
with a sufficient escort should make for Egypt, where
several legions were in garrison, and where even if the army
now camped beside the Ambracian Gulf could not be
extricated from its difficulties, another army might be
formed to prolong the war.</p>

<p>But the withdrawal of the sixty ships threw the odds
of battle heavily against the rest of Antony's fleet. And
matters were made worse by its leader suddenly allowing
his infatuation for the Queen of Egypt to sweep away all
sense of his duty to his comrades and followers and his
honour as a commander. As he saw Cleopatra's sails
curving round his line and making for the open sea, he
hastily left his flagship, boarded a small and swift galley,
and sped after the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Agrippa was too good a leader to weaken his attack on
the main body of the enemy by any attempt to interrupt
the flight of the Egyptian squadron. When he saw the
galley of Antony following it, he guessed who was on
board, and detached a few of his triremes in pursuit.
Antony was saved from capture only by the rearward
ships of the fugitive squadron turning back to engage and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
delay the pursuers. In this rearguard fight two of the
Egyptian warships were captured by Agrippa's cruisers.
But meanwhile Antony's galley had run alongside of the
royal flagship of the Egyptian fleet, and he had been
welcomed on board by Cleopatra.</p>

<p>By this time, however, he had begun to realize the
consequences of his flight. Half an hour ago he had stood
on the deck of a fighting ship, where comrades who had
made his cause their own were doing brave battle against
his enemies. Now, while the fight still raged far away
astern, he found himself on the deck of a pleasure yacht,
glittering with gold and silver, silk and ivory, and with
women and slaves forming a circle round the Queen, who
greeted him as he trod the carpeted deck. He made only
a brief acknowledgment of her welcome, and then turned
away and strode forward to the bow, where he sat alone,
huddled together, brooding on thoughts of failure and
disgrace, while the royal galley and its escort of warships
sped southward with oar and sail, and the din of battle
died away in the distance, and all sight of it was lost
beyond the horizon.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the Egyptians was a palpable discouragement
to all the fleet, but not all were aware that
their leader, Antony, had shared Cleopatra's flight. Some
of those who realized what had happened gave up all
further effort for victory, and leaving the line drove
ashore on the sandy beach of Actium, and abandoning
their ships joined the spectators from the camp. Others
made their way by the strait into the great land-locked
haven of the Gulf. But most of the fleet still kept up the
fight. The great ships that drifted helplessly, with broken
oars, among the agile galleys of Agrippa's Liburnian
sailors, or that grounded in the shallows nearer the
shore, were, even in their helplessness as ships, formidable
floating forts that it was difficult to sink and
dangerous to storm. More than one attempt to board
was repulsed with loss, the high bulwarks and towers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
giving an advantage to the large fighting contingents
that Antony had embarked. Some of them had drifted
together, and were lashed side to side, so that their crews
could mutually aid each other, and their archers bring a
cross fire on the assailants of their wooden towers. Some
ships had been sunk on both sides, and a few of the towered
warships of the Eastern fleet had been captured by Agrippa,
but at the cost of much loss of life.</p>

<p>To complete the destruction of the Antonian fleet, and
secure his victory, Agrippa now adopted means that
could not have been suddenly improvised, and must
therefore have been prepared in advance, perhaps at the
earlier period, when he was considering the chances of
forcing a way into the Gulf. Fire was the new weapon,
arrows wreathed with oiled and blazing tow were shot
at the towers and bulwarks of the enemy. Rafts laden
with combustibles were set on fire, and towed or pushed
down upon the drifting sea-castles. Ship after ship burst
into flame. As the fire spread some tried vainly to master
it; others, at an early stage, abandoned their ships, or
surrendered. As the resistance of the defeated armada
gradually slackened, and about four o'clock came to an
end, it was found that a number of ships had taken refuge
in the narrows and the Gulf; others were aground on the
point; a few had been sunk, some more had surrendered,
but numbers were drifting on the sea, wrapped in smoke
and flame. Some of these sank as the fire reached the
water's edge, and the waves lapped into the hollow hull,
or the weight of half-consumed upper works capsized them.
Others drifted ashore in the shallows, and reddened sea
and land with the glare of their destruction far into the
night.</p>

<p>For the men who had fought, the victory, complete as it
was, had an element of disappointment. They had hoped
to secure as a prize the treasures of Cleopatra, but these
had been spirited away on the Egyptian fleet. But for
the commanders, Octavian and his able lieutenant, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
was nothing to regret. The battle had once more decided
the issue between East and West, and had given Octavian
such advantages that it would be his own fault if he were
not soon master of the Roman World.</p>

<p>Within a few days the remnant of the defeated fleet
had been surrendered or burned at its anchors. The army
of Canidius, after a half-hearted attempt at an inland
march, and after being further weakened by desertions,
declared for Octavian, and joined his standards.</p>

<p>Cleopatra had entered the port of Alexandria with a
pretence of returning in triumph from a naval victory.
Laurel wreaths hung on spars and bulwarks, flags flew,
trumpets sounded, and she received the enthusiastic
greetings of Greeks and Egyptians as she landed. But the
truth could not be long concealed, and under the blight of
defeat, linked with stories of leaders deserting comrades and
allies, Antony and Cleopatra failed to rally any determined
support to their side when the conqueror of Actium came
to threaten Egypt itself. Both ended their lives with their
own hands, Cleopatra only resorting to this act of desperation
when, after breaking with Antony, she failed to enslave
Octavian with her charms, and foresaw that she would
appear among the prisoners at his coming triumph in
Rome.</p>

<p>2 September, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 31&mdash;the day of Actium&mdash;is the date
which most historians select to mark the end of the Roman
Republic and the beginning of the Empire. The victor
Octavian had already taken the name of his grand-uncle,
C&aelig;sar. He now adopted the title of Augustus, and accepted
from army and senate the permanent rank of Imperator,
inaugurating a system of absolutism that kept some of the
forms of the old Republic as a thin disguise for the change
to Imperialism.</p>

<p>On the height where he had camped before the battle,
Nicopolis, the City of Victory, was erected. The ground
where his tent had stood was the marble-paved forum,
adorned with the brazen beaks of conquered warships.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
The temple of Apollo, on the point of Actium, was rebuilt
on more ambitious lines, and on the level expanse of sandy
ground behind it, every September, for some two hundred
years, the "Actian games" were held to celebrate the
decisive victory.</p>

<p>Augustus did not forget that to the fleet he had owed
his success in the civil war, and naval stations were
organized and squadrons of warships kept in commission
even in the long days of peace that followed his victory.
They served to keep the Mediterranean free from the plague
of piracy, and to secure the growing oversea commerce of
the Empire which had made the Mediterranean a vast
Roman lake.</p>

<p class="title">
THE BATTLE OF SVOLD ISLAND<br />
A.D. 1000</p>


<p>In the story of the battles of Salamis and Actium we
have seen what naval warfare was like in Greek and
Roman times. It would be easy to add other examples,
but they would be only repetitions of much the same story,
for during the centuries of the Roman power there was no
marked change in naval architecture or the tactics of
warfare on the sea.</p>

<p>We pass, then, over a thousand years to a record of naval
war waged in the beginning of the Middle Ages by northern
races&mdash;people who had, independently of Greek or Roman,
evolved somewhat similar types of ships, but who were
better sailors, though for all that they still used the ship
not so much as an engine of war as the floating platform
on which warriors might meet in hand-to-hand conflict.
Norseman, Dane, and Swede were all of kindred blood.
The land-locked Baltic, the deep fiords of the Scandinavian
Peninsula, the straits and inlets of the archipelago that
fringes its North Sea coast, were the waters on which they
learned such skill in seamanship that they soon launched
out upon the open sea, and made daring voyages, not only
to the Orkneys and the Hebrides, and the Atlantic seaboard
of Ireland, but the Faroes, and to still more distant
Iceland and Greenland, and then southward to "Vineland,"
the mainland of America, long after rediscovered by
the navigators of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>There is a considerable intermixture of Norse blood in
the peoples of Great Britain and Ireland, and perhaps from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
this sea-loving race comes some of the spirit of adventure
that has helped so much to build up our own naval power.
When Nelson destroyed and captured the Danish fleet at
Copenhagen, the Danes consoled themselves by saying that
only a leader of their own blood could have conquered them,
and that Nelson's name showed he came of the Viking
line.</p>

<p>A chronicler tells how Charlemagne in his old age once
came to a village on the North Sea shore, and camped
beside it. Looking to seaward he saw far out some long
low ships, with gaily painted oars, dragon-shaped bows,
and sails made of brightly coloured lengths of stuff sewn
together and adorned with embroidery along the yard.
Tears came to his eyes as he said: "These sea-dragons
will tear asunder the empire I have made."</p>

<p>They were Viking cruisers, on their way to plunder some
coast town; and the old Emperor's prophecy was verified
when the Norman, who was a civilized Norseman, became
for a while the conquering race of Europe. Even before the
death of Charlemagne the Norse and Danish sea-kings
were raiding, plundering, and burning along the coasts of
his Empire. Two hundred years of our own history is made
up of the story of their incursions. England and Ireland
bore the first brunt of their onset, when they found the
ways of the sea. But they ravaged all the western coasts
of Europe, and even showed themselves in the Mediterranean.
From the end of the eighth till the beginning of
the eleventh century they were the terror of the western
world, and early in that dark and stormy period their
raids had grown into great expeditions; they landed
armies that marched far inland, and they carved out
principalities for themselves.</p>

<p>Western Europe had a brief respite at times when the
Vikings fought amongst themselves. In early days there
were frequent struggles for supremacy in Norway, between
local kinglets and ambitious chiefs. Fighting was in the
blood of the Northmen. Two sea-roving squadrons would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sometimes challenge each other to battle for the mere sake
of a fight. As Norway coalesced into a single kingdom,
and as the first teachers of Christianity induced the kings
to suppress piracy, there was more of peace and order on
the Northern Seas. But in this transition period there was
more than one struggle between the Scandinavian kingdoms,
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. One of the most famous
battles of these northern wars of the sea-kings was fought
in this period, when the old wild days of sea-roving were
drawing to an end, and its picturesque story may well be
told as that of a typical Norse battle, for its hero, King
Olaf Tryggveson, was the ideal of a northern sea-king.</p>

<p>Olaf was a descendant of the race of Harold Haarfager,
"Fair-haired Harold," the warrior who had united the
kingdom of Norway, and made himself its chief king at the
close of the ninth century. But Olaf came of a branch of
the royal house that civil war had reduced to desperate
straits. He was born when his mother, Astrid, was a
fugitive in a lonely island of the Baltic. As a boy he was
sold into slavery in Russia. There, one day, in the marketplace
of an Esthonian town, he was recognized by a relative,
Sigurd, the brother of Astrid, and was freed from bondage
and trained to arms as a page at the Court of the Norse
adventurers who ruled the land. The "Saga" tells how Olaf,
the son of Tryggva, grew to be tall of stature, and strong
of limb, and skilled in every art of land and sea, of peace
and war. None swifter than he on the snow-shoes in
winter, no bolder swimmer when the summer had cleared the
ice from the waters. He could throw darts with both hands,
he could toss up two swords, catching them like a juggler,
and keeping one always in the air. He could climb rocks
and peaks like a mountain goat. He could row and sail,
and had been known to display his daring skill as an athlete
by running along the moving oars outside the ship. He
could ride a horse, and fight, mounted or on foot, with axe
or sword, with spear or bow.</p>

<p>In early manhood he came back to Norway to avenge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the death of his father Tryggva, and then took to
sea-roving, for piracy was still the Norseman's trade. He
raided the shores of the Continent from Friesland to
Northern France, but most of his piratical voyages were
to the shores of our own islands, and many a seaboard
town in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland saw Olaf's
plundering squadron of swift ships. Five was the number
of them with which he visited the Orkneys.</p>

<p>The Viking warships were small vessels. The ship dug out
of the great grave mound at Sandefjord, in Norway, and
now shown at Christiania, is seventy-seven feet long, with
a beam of seventeen amidships, and a depth of just under
six feet. Her draught of water would be only four feet,
and she would lie very low in the water, but her lines are
those of a good sea boat. She had one mast, forty feet high,
to carry a crossyard and a square sail, and she had thirty-two
oars, sixteen on each side. It says something for the
seamanship of the Northmen that it was with ships like this
they sailed the Atlantic waves off the west coast of Ireland,
and made their way by the North Sea and the verge of the
Arctic to the Faroes, Iceland, Greenland, and the mysterious
"Vineland."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Raiding in the Irish Sea, Olaf Tryggveson made a stay
in a harbour of the Scilly Islands, and there he became a
convert to Christianity. On the same voyage he married
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the Countess Gyde, sister of his namesake, Olaf Kvaran,
the Danish King of Dublin. It was while he was staying in
Ireland with the Dublin Danes that he heard news from
Norway that opened larger ambitions to him. The land
was divided among many chiefs, and the most powerful
of them was hated as an oppressor by the people, who,
he was told, would gladly welcome as their king a leader
as famed as Olaf Tryggveson, and representing the line
of Harold the Fair-haired. Helped by the Danes of Ireland,
he sailed back to Norway, to win its crown for himself, and
to cast down the worship of Thor and Odin, and make
the land part of Christendom.</p>

<p>In the first enterprise he was quickly successful, and in
995 he was recognized as King of Norway at Trondhjem.
During the five years that he reigned he devoted much of
his energy to the second part of his mission, and made
among his countrymen many real converts, and found still
more ready to accept external conformity. Sometimes he
would argue, exhort, appeal to the reason and the goodwill
of chiefs and people. But often the old Viking spirit
of his pagan days would master him, and he would hack
down with his battle-axe the emblems and the altars of
Thor and Odin, and challenge the old gods to avenge the
insult if they had the power, and then tell the startled onlookers
that if they were to be loyal to him and live in
peace they must accept the new and better creed.</p>

<p>The open sea and the deep fiords running far into the
hills were the best highways of his kingdom, and Olaf
spared no effort to maintain a good fighting fleet, the best
ships of which lay anchored before his great hall at Trondhjem
when he was at home. When he went out to war his
path was by the sea. He hunted down the pirates and
destroyed their strongholds in the northern fiords, with
none the less zeal because these places were also the last
refuge of the old paganism and its Berserker magicians.</p>

<p>He had built for his own use a ship called the "Crane"
(<i>Tranen</i>), longer than ships were usually made at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
time, and also of narrower beam. Her additional length
enabled more oars to be used, and her sharp bow, carved
into a bird's head, and her graceful lines made her the
fastest ship in the fiords when a good crew of rowers was
swinging to the oars. A good rowing-boat is generally a
bad sailer, but Olaf had made the "Crane" swift enough
under canvas, or to speak more accurately, when her
sails of brightly dyed wool were spread. She was given
high bulwarks, and must have had more than the usual
four-foot draught of water, for she carried plenty of heavy
stone ballast to stiffen her under sail. With the "Crane"
as his flagship, Olaf sailed northward to attack the Viking
Raud, pirate and magician, who held out for the old gods
and the old wild ways. Raud had another exceptionally
large ship, the longest in Norway, and till the "Crane"
was built the swiftest also. The bow, carved into a dragon's
head and covered with brazen scales, gave Raud's ship
the name of the "Serpent" (<i>Ormen</i>). As Olaf sailed
northward Raud and his allies met him in a skirmish at
sea, but soon gave way to superior numbers, and Raud,
when he steered the "Serpent" into the recesses of
Salten Fiord, thought he had shaken off pursuit, especially
as the weather had broken, and wild winds, stormy seas,
and driving mists and rain squalls might well make the
fiord inaccessible to Olaf's fleet. Raud sat late feasting
and drinking, and in the early morning he still lay in a
drunken sleep when the "Crane" slipped into the fiord
despite mist and storm, and Olaf seized the dragon ship
and made Raud a prisoner almost without striking a
blow.</p>

<p>When the King returned to Trondhjem he had the two
finest ships of the north, the "Crane" and the "Serpent,"
the latter the largest, the former the swiftest vessel that
had yet been launched on the northern seas. Proud of such
weapons, he wondered if he could not build a warship
longer than the "Serpent" and swifter than the "Crane,"
and he consulted his best shipbuilder, Thorberg Haarklover,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
i.e. the "Hair-splitter," so named from his deftness
with the sharp adze, the shipwright's characteristic tool
in the days of wooden walls. Thorberg was given a free
hand, and promised to build a ship that would be famous
for centuries. This was the "Lang Ormen," or "Long Serpent,"
a "Dreadnought" of those old Viking days. She
was 150 feet long, and her sides rose high out of the water,
but she had also a deep draught. The bow, strengthened
with a cut-water of steel, was fashioned like the head of
a huge dragon, the stern carved into a dragon's tail, and
bow and stern were covered with scales of gold. She had
sixty oars, and her crew was made up of no less than six
hundred picked men, among them warriors whose names
live in history.</p>

<p>For a while Olaf, with his great ships, reigned victoriously
over Norway, defeating more than one effort
of the old pagan Vikings to shake his power. One of
these defeated rivals, Erik Jarl (Earl Erik), took refuge
in Sweden, gathered there a number of adherents
who had like himself fled from Norway to avoid Olaf's
strong-handed methods of reform and conversion, and
with them sailed the Baltic, plundering its coasts in the
old Viking fashion. King Svend of Denmark was jealous
of the power of Norway, welcomed Erik at his Court, and
gave him his daughter's hand. Svend's queen, Sigrid,
was a Swedish princess, and Erik set to work to form a
triple league against Norway of which the three branches
would be his own following of Norwegian malcontents and
the Swedes and Danes.</p>

<p>Olaf had spent the summer of the year 1000, with a
fleet of sixty ships, in the South-Eastern Baltic. Autumn
was coming, and the King was preparing to return home
before the wintry weather began, when news arrived that
hastened his departure. It was brought by one of his
jarls, Earl Sigvald, who came with eleven ships, manned
by his clansmen, and reported that the rebel Erik had been
joined by the kings of Sweden and Denmark, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
three fleets of the allies were preparing to fall upon Olaf
on his homeward voyage. But Sigvald assured the King
that if he would allow him to pilot the Norwegian fleet
he would take it safely through channels deep enough for
even the "Long Serpent," and elude the hostile armada,
which outnumbered Olaf's fleet three to one.</p>

<p>Sigvald, however, was a traitor. He had promised to
lead Olaf into waters where the allied fleets would be
waiting to attack him. And he knew they would be
anchored inside the island of R&uuml;gen, near the islet of
Svold.</p>

<p>So Olaf, trusting to his false friend, sailed westward
from Wendland to his last battle. The "Saga" tells how
on a bright morning, Erik Jarl and the two kings watched
from Svold the approach of the Norwegian ships, and at
first doubted if Olaf was with them, but when they saw
the "Long Serpent" towering above the rest they doubted
no longer, and gave orders for their 180 ships to clear
for action, agreeing that Norway should be divided among
them and the "Long Serpent" should be the prize of
whoever first set foot on her deck, so sure were they that
numbers would give them victory even against a champion
of the seas like Olaf Tryggveson. The swift "Crane" and
the "Short Serpent," taken from Raud of Salten Fiord,
had sailed ahead of the fleet. They saw the ships of the
allies crowding out of the channel between Svold and the
mainland, and turned back to give the alarm. Thorkild,
the half-brother of Olaf, who commanded the "Short
Serpent," urged the King to bear out to sea and avoid
a fight with such desperate odds. But Olaf's blood was up.
Like the triremes of the Mediterranean, the "Serpents,"
"Dragons," and "Cranes" of the northern seas used
only the oars in battle, and the King gave the order which
meant fighting. "Down with the sails!" he said. "Who
talks of running away? I never fled yet and never will.
My life is in God's hands, but flight would be shame for
ever."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>The battle that followed is the most famous in Viking
story. We know it chiefly through poetic records. But
there is no doubt the "Saga" preserves for us much of the
living tradition of the time, and if its writers yielded to the
temptation of decorating their narrative with picturesque
detail, it must be remembered that they told the tale of
Olaf's last sea-fight to men who knew from experience
what Northern war was like, so they give us what we
chiefly want, a lifelike picture of a Viking battle.</p>

<p>Just as Shakespeare tells how at Shrewsbury "the
King had many marching in his coats," and to this day
in an Abyssinian army several nobles are dressed and
armed like the King to divert personal attack from him,
so, as he stood on the after-deck of the "Long Serpent,"
Olaf had beside him one of his best warriors, Kolbiorn
Slatter, a man like himself in height and build, and wearing
the same splendid armour, with gilded shield and helmet
and crimson cloak. Round them were grouped the picked
fighting men of the bodyguard, the "Shield-burg," so
called because it was their duty to form a breastwork of
their shields and ward off arrows and javelins from the
King. On the poop also were the King's trumpeters bearing
the "war horns"&mdash;long horns of the wild ox, which
now sounded the signal for battle. The droning call was
taken up by ship after ship, as the shouting sailors sent
down sails and yards on deck. The ships closed on each
other side by side, and drew in their oars, forming in close
line abreast, and then under bare masts the long array
of war galleys, with their high bows carved into heads of
beasts and birds and dragons, drifted with the current
towards the hostile fleet.</p>

<p>The sailors were lashing the ships together as they moved.
Man&#0339;uvring appears to have had small part in most
Viking fights. The fleet became one great floating fortress,
and as the ships met bow to bow the best warriors fought
hand to hand on the forecastle decks.</p>

</div>

<p>The writer of the "Saga" tells how in the centre of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
fleet the "Long Serpent" lay, with the "Crane" and the
"Short Serpent" to port and starboard. The sterns of
the three ships were in line, and so the bow of the "Long
Serpent" projected far in front of the rest. As the sailors
secured the ships in position, Ulf the Red-haired, who
commanded on the forecastle of the "Long Serpent," went
aft and called out to the King that if the "Serpent" lay
so far ahead he and his men would have tough work in the
bow. "Are you afraid?" asked the King. "We are no
more afraid forward than you are aft," replied Ulf, with
a flash of anger. The King lost his temper and threatened
Ulf with an arrow on his bowstring. "Put down your
bow," said Ulf. "If you shoot me you wound your own
hand," and then he went back to his post on the forecastle
deck.</p>

<p>The allied fleet was now formed in line and bearing
down on the Norwegians. Sigvald Jarl, who had lured the
King into this ambush, hung back with his eleven ships,
and Olaf with his sixty had to meet a threefold force.
King Svend, with the Danish fleet, formed the enemy's
centre. To his right Olaf's namesake, King Olaf Svensker,
led the Swedish ships. On the left was Erik, with the
rebel heathen Jarls of Norway. Olaf watched the enemy's
approach and talked to Kolbiorn and the men of the Shield-burg.
He did not reckon that the Danes or the Swedes
would give much trouble, he said; the Danes were soft
fellows, and the Swedes would be better "at home pickling
fish" than risking themselves in fight with Norsemen, but
Erik's attack would be dangerous. "These are Norwegians
like ourselves. It will be hard against hard."</p>

<p>Perhaps we have here a touch of flattery for his countrymen
from the poet of the "Saga," a Norseman telling the
tale to men of his own race. However this may be, the
words put into Olaf's mouth were true so far as the rebel
Jarls were concerned, even if they did injustice to Dane
and Swede.</p>

<p>Erik Jarl seems to have had some inventive talent and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
some idea of naval tactics. His ship was called the
"Iron Beard," because her bows bristled with sharpened
spikes of iron. She was to be herself a weapon, not merely
a means of bringing fighting men to close quarters for a
hand-to-hand struggle. It is remarkable that, though it
proved useful at the battle of Svold, the armed bow found
no regular place in Viking warfare. The "Iron Beard"
also anticipated modern methods in another way. Her
bulwarks were covered with iron-plating. It cannot have
been of any serious thickness, for a Viking ship had not
enough displacement to spare for carrying heavy armour;
but the thin plates were strong enough to be a defence
against arrows and spears, and as these would not penetrate
a thick wooden bulwark it seems likely that the
plating was fixed on a rail running along each side, thus
giving a higher protection than the bulwark itself. Erik's
ship was thus a primitive ironclad ram.</p>

<p>Though Olaf had spoken lightly of the Danes, it was
King Svend's squadron that began the fight, rowing forward
in advance of the rest and falling on the right and
right centre of Olaf's fleet. The Swedes at first hung back.
Svend himself on the left of the Danish attack steered
straight for the projecting bows of the "Long Serpent."
Red-haired Ulf grappled the Danish King's ship, boarded
her, and after a fierce fight in which the Norwegian battle-axes
did deadly work, cleared her from end to end. King
Svend saved his life by clambering on board of another ship.
Olaf and his men from the high stern of the "Long Serpent"
shot their arrows with telling effect into the Danish
ships. All along the centre the Norwegians held their
own, and gradually the Danes began to give way. It was
then only the Swedes worked their ships into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
that raged in front of the line of Norwegian bows. To
have swept round the line and attacked in flank and rear,
while the Danes still grappled it in front, would have been
a more effective method of attack, but the opponents
thought only of meeting front to front like fighting bulls.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
It may be too that Olaf's fleet had so drifted that there
was not much room to pass between its right wing on the
land.</p>

<p>But however this may be, there was plenty of sea room
on the left, and here Erik Jarl, in the "Iron Beard," led
the attack and used his advantage to the full. Part of his
squadron fell upon the Norwegian front; but the "Iron
Beard" and several of her consorts swung round the end
of the line, and concentrated their attack on the outside
ship. Erik had grasped a cardinal principle of naval
tactics, the importance of trying to crush a part of the
hostile line by bringing a local superiority of force to bear
upon it. It was "hard against hard"&mdash;Viking against
Viking&mdash;but the Norwegians in the end ship were hopelessly
outnumbered. They fought furiously and sold their
lives dearly; but soon the armed bow of the "Iron
Beard" drove between their ship and the next, the lashings
were cut, and the Norwegian drifted out of the line,
with her deck heaped with dead. Erik let her drift and
attacked the next ship in the same way. He was eating
up Olaf's left wing ship by ship, while the Danes and Swedes
kept the centre and right busy.</p>

<p>It was the bloodiest fight that the North had ever seen,
a fight to the death, for though there was now small
hope of victory, the Norse battle madness was strong
in Olaf and his men. As the day wore on the right held
its own; but one by one every ship on the left had been
cleared by Erik and the Jarls, and now the battle raged
round the three great ships in the centre, the "Crane"
and the two "Serpents." Erik came up and drove the
bow of the "Iron Beard" into the "Long Serpent's"
bulwarks. The rebel Jarl stood on the forecastle behind
the bristling spikes, his blood-stained battle-axe in hand
and his Shield-burg standing close around him.</p>

<p>They had now hard work to ward off the arrows that
came whistling from the "Long Serpent," for at such
close quarters Erik had been recognized, and more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
one archer shot at him. The "Saga" tells how young
Einar Tamberskelver, the best of the bowmen of Norway,
so strong that he could send a blunt arrow through a bull's
hide, had posted himself in the rigging of the "Long
Serpent" and made the rebel Jarl his mark. His arrows
rattled on the shields of Erik's guard. One of them grazed
his helmet, whistled over the "Iron Beard's" deck and
buried itself in her rudder-head. Crouching in the bow of
the "Iron Beard" behind her armour plates was a Finnish
archer, and the Finlanders were such good bowmen that
men said sorcery aided their skill. Erik told him to shoot
the man in the "Serpent's" rigging. The Finn, to show
his marksmanship, aimed at Einar's bowstring and cut it
with his arrow. The bow released from the string sprang
open and broke with a loud report. "What is that
sound?" asked Olaf. Einar sprang down from the rigging
and answered, "It is the sound of the sceptre of Norway
falling from your grasp." It was noticed that Olaf's
hand was bleeding, "his gauntlet was full of blood," but
he had given no sign when he was wounded. Arrows,
javelins, and stones were falling in showers on the decks
of the "Crane" and the "Serpents," for the Danes and
Swedes worsted in the close fight had drawn off a little,
and were helping Erik's attack by thus fighting at a safer
distance.</p>

<p>Erik now boarded the "Long Serpent" amidships, but
was beaten back. He brought up more of his ships and
gathered a larger boarding-party. The Danish and Swedish
arrows had thinned the ranks of Ulf's men in the "Long
Serpent's" bows. When Erik led a second storming-party
on board, Danes and Swedes too came clambering over
the bow, and the "Long Serpent" attacked on all sides
was cleared to the poop. Here Olaf fought with Kolbiorn,
Einar and the men of the Shield-burg around him. He
was somewhat disabled by his wounded hand, but he still
used his battle-axe with deadly effect. The attacking
party were not quite sure which of the tall men in gilded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
armour was the King, but at such close quarters some of
them soon recognized him, and Erik called to his men
not to kill Olaf, but to make him prisoner. Olaf knew
well that if his life was spared for a while it would be only
to put him to death finally with the cruelty the heathen
Vikings delighted in inflicting on their enemies. As his
men fell round him and his party was driven further and
further astern, he must have seen that, outnumbered as
his men were, and with himself wounded, he would soon
be overmastered and made prisoner. There was just one
chance of escape for the best swimmer in Norway. Holding
up his shield he stepped on the bulwark, threw the shield
at his enemies, and dived overboard. Kolbiorn tried to
dive with him, but was seized and dragged back to the
ship. When Erik found he was not the King he spared
his life.</p>

<p>The few who remained of the Shield-burg sprang overboard.
Some were killed by men who were waiting in
boats to dispose of the fugitives, others escaped by diving
and swimming, and reached Danish and Swedish ships
where they asked for, and were given, quarter. Einar, the
archer, was one of those thus saved, and he is heard of
later in the Danish wars of England.</p>

<p>Olaf was never seen again. Sigvald's ships, after having
watched the fight from afar, were rowing up to the victorious
fleets, and for a long time there was a rumour that
King Olaf had slipped out of his coat of mail as he swam
under water, and then rose and eluded Erik's boats, and
reached one of Sigvald's ships, where he was hidden. The
tale ran that he had been taken back to Wendland, where
he was waiting to reappear some day in Norway and claim
his own. But years went on and there were no tidings of
King Olaf Tryggveson. He had been drowned in his
armour under the stern of the "Long Serpent."</p>

<p>King Olaf is still, after nine centuries, one of the popular
heroes of the Norwegian people. He had a twofold fame,
as the ideal of a sea-king, as the ruler who tried in his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
wild untaught way to win the land of the Fiords to Christendom.
Another Olaf, who completed this last work a few
years later, and who, like Olaf Tryggveson, reigned over
Norway in right of his prowess and his descent from Harold
the Fair-haired, is remembered as St. Olaf, saint and
martyr; but no exploit of either king lives in popular
tradition so brightly as the story of Olaf Tryggveson's
death-battle at Svold. "My life is in God's hands," he
had said, "but flight would be shame for ever." His fight
against desperate odds and ending in defeat and death won
him fame for ever.</p>

<p class="title">
SLUYS<br />
1340</p>


<p>The gold "nobles" of the coinage of King Edward&nbsp;III
show in conventional fashion the King standing in
the waist of a ship with a high bow and poop, the red-cross
banner of St. George at the stern and the lions of England
and the lilies of France emblazoned on his shield. The
device typifies his claim to the sovereignty of the narrow
seas between England and the Continent, the prize won
for him by the fleet that conquered at Sluys.</p>

<p>Sluys is often spoken of as the sea-fight that inaugurated
the long victorious career of the British Navy. It would
be more correct to say that it was the battle which, by
giving King Edward the command of the Channel, made
his successful invasion of France possible, and secured for
England the possession of Calais. Holding both Dover
and Calais the English for two centuries were masters
of the narrow sea-gate through which all the trade between
northern Europe and the rest of the world had to pass.
They had the power of bringing severe pressure to bear
upon the German cities of the Hansa League, the traders
of the Low Countries, the merchants of Spain, Genoa, and
Venice, by their control of this all-important waterway.
Hence the claim upheld till the seventeenth century that
the King of England was "Sovereign of the Seas," and that
in the Channel and the North Sea every foreign ship had
to lower her sails and salute any English "King's ship"
that she met.</p>

<p>Sluys, which had such far-reaching consequences, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
not the first of English naval victories. Alfred the Great
maintained in the latter part of his reign a fleet of small
ships to guard the coasts against the Norse and Danish
pirates, and this won him the name of founder of the British
Navy. But for centuries after there was no attempt at
forming or keeping up a regular naval establishment.
Alfred's navy must have been dispersed under his weaker
successors, for the Northmen never found any serious
obstacles to their raids. Harold had no navy, and the
result was that in a single twelvemonth England was twice
invaded, first by Harold Hadrada and Tostig, who were
beaten at Stamford Bridge, and then by William the Norman,
who conquered at Hastings. But even the Conqueror
had no fighting fleet. His ships were used merely to
ferry his army across the Channel, and he made no attempt
to use them against the Northmen who harried the east
coast. The record of victory begins with the reign of
King John, when in 1213 William Longsword, his half-brother,
with a fleet gathered from the shipping of Dover
and the south-eastern ports, destroyed a French fleet that
had assembled on the coast of the Netherlands to transport
an invading army to England. Damme (i.e. "the
dams or embankments to keep out the sea") was then a
fortified port. It is now a Dutch village, some miles from
the coast, in the midst of green meadows won from the
sea, with roads shaded by avenues of trees, and only the
traffic of its canal to remind it that it once had a harbour.</p>

<p>Four years later Hubert de Burgh, Governor of Dover
Castle, defeated another attempted raid on England by
improvising a fleet and attacking the French squadron in
the Straits. De Burgh got to windward of the French, then
sailed down on them, grappled and boarded them. There
was an incident which happily we do not hear of again in
naval warfare. As the English scrambled on board of
the French ships they threw quicklime in the eyes of their
opponents. It was, no doubt, an ugly trick of piratical
fighting, for in those days when there was no police of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
seas there was a certain amount of piracy and smuggling
carried on by the men of Dover and the Cinque Ports.
Just as for lack of police protection highway robbery was
a danger of travel by road, so till organized naval power
developed there was a good deal of piracy in the European
seas, and peaceful traders sailed in large fleets for mutual
protection, just as travellers on land took care to have
companions for a journey. The Channel was also enlivened
by occasional fights for fishing-grounds between
fleets of fishing-craft, and the quicklime trick of Hubert
de Burgh's battle was probably one of the methods of this
irregular warfare.</p>

<p>Edward&nbsp;I had a navy which did useful service by coasting
northward, as his armies marched into Scotland, and
securing for them regular supplies and reinforcements by
sea. Under his weak successor the sea was neglected, and
it was the third Edward who used the navy effectually to
secure that his quarrel with France should be fought out,
not on English ground, but on the Continent, and thus
became the founder of the sea power of England.</p>

<p>There was no Royal Navy in the modern sense of the
term. When the King went to war his fleet was recruited
from three different sources. The warship was a merchantman,
on board of which a number of fighting-men, knights,
men-at-arms, archers and billmen were embarked. These
were more numerous than the crew of sailors which navigated
the ship, for the largest vessels of the time were not
of more than two to three hundred tons, and as oars were
not used in the rough seas of the Channel and there was
only one mast with a single square sail, and perhaps a jib-foresail,
the necessary hands for sailing her were few.
There was a dual command, the knight or noble who
led the fighting-men being no sailor, and having a pilot
under him who commanded the sailors and navigated the
ship. This dual arrangement (which we have seen at work
in the fleets of more ancient days) left its traces in our Navy
up to the middle of the nineteenth century, when ships of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the Royal Navy still had, besides the captain, a "sailing
master" among their officers.</p>

<p>The King owned a small number of ships, which he
maintained just as he kept a number of knights in his pay
to form his personal retinue on land. During peace he
hired these ships out to merchants, and when he called
them back for war service he took the crews that navigated
them into his pay, and sent his fighting-men on board.
But the King's ships were the least numerous element in
the war fleet. Merchantmen were impressed for service
from London and the other maritime towns and cities, the
feudal levy providing the fighting complement. A third
element in the fleet was obtained from the Cinque Ports.
There were really seven, not five, of them&mdash;Dover, Hythe,
Hastings, Winchelsea, Rye, Romney, and Sandwich.
Under their charter they enjoyed valuable privileges, in
return for which they were bound to provide, when the
King called upon them, fifty-seven ships and twelve hundred
men and boys for fifteen days at their own expense,
and as long after as the King paid the necessary charges.
The naming of so short a term of service shows that maritime
operations were expected not to last long. It was,
indeed, a difficult matter to keep a medieval fleet at sea,
and the conditions that produced this state of things lasted
far into the modern period. Small ships crowded with
fighting-men had no room for any large store of provisions
and water. When the first scanty supply was exhausted,
unless they were in close touch with a friendly port, they
had to be accompanied by a crowd of storeships, and as
the best merchantmen would naturally have been impressed
for the actual fighting, these would be small, inferior,
and less seaworthy ships, and the fleet would have
to pay as much attention to guarding its convoy as to
operating against an enemy. No wonder that as a rule
the most that could be attempted was a short voyage and
a single stroke.</p>

<p>It was in 1340 that King Edward&nbsp;III challenged the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
title of Philip of Valois to the crown of France, and by
claiming it for himself began "the Hundred Years' War."
Both sides to the quarrel began to collect fleets and armies,
and both realized that the first struggle would be on the
sea. It would be thus decided whether the war was to be
fought out on French or on English ground.</p>

<p>The French King collected ships from his ports and
strengthened his fleet by hiring a number of large warships
from Genoa, then one of the great maritime republics
of the Mediterranean. The Genoese sailors knew
the northern seas, for there were always some of their ships
in the great trading fleet that passed up the Channel each
spring, bringing the produce of the Mediterranean countries
and the East to the northern ports of Europe, and returned
in the late summer laden with the merchandise of the
Hansa traders.</p>

<p>Early in the year King Philip had assembled a hundred
and ninety ships, large and small, French and Genoese, off
the little town of Sluys on the coast of Flanders. The fleet
lay in the estuary of the river Eede. Like Damme, Sluys
has now become an inland village. Its name means "the
sluice," and, like Damme, reminds us how the people of the
Netherlands have for centuries been winning their land
from the sea by their great system of dams to keep the sea-water
back, and sluices to carry the river-water to the sea.
The estuary of the Eede where the French fleet anchored
is now pasture land traversed by a canal, and the embankments
that keep the sea from the meadow lands lie some
miles to the westward of the place where King Edward
won his great naval victory.</p>

<p>Had the French acted at once, there was nothing to
prevent them from opening the war by invading England.
Perhaps they did not know how slowly the English fleet
was assembling.</p>

<p>In the late spring when the French armament was
nearly complete, King Edward had only forty ships
ready. They lay in the estuaries of the Orwell and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Stour, inside Harwich, long a place of importance for
English naval wars in the North Sea. Gradually, week
after week, other ships came in from the Thames, and the
northern seaports, from Southampton and the Cinque
Ports, and even from Bristol, creeping slowly along the
coasts from harbour to harbour. All this time the French
might have swept the seas and destroyed the English in
detail; but they waited for more ships and more men,
and the time of opportunity went by.</p>

<p>At last in the beginning of June the English King had
two hundred ships assembled, from decked vessels down to
open sailing-boats. An army crowded on board of them,
knights and nobles in shining armour, burghers and
peasants in steel caps and leather jerkins, armed with the
long-bow or the combined pike and long battle-axe known
as the "bill." The King's ship flew the newly adopted
royal standard in which the golden lions on a red field, the
arms of England, were quartered with the golden lilies of
France on a field of blue, and another banner displaying
the device that is still the flag of the Royal Navy, the Red
Cross of St. George on a field of white, the banner adopted
by Richard C&#0339;ur de Lion in his Crusade. The other ships
flew the banners of the barons and knights who commanded
them, and on the royal ship and those of the chief commanders
there were trumpeters whose martial notes were
to give the signal for battle. As a knight of the Middle
Ages despised the idea of fighting on foot, and there might
be a landing in Flanders, some of the barons had provided
for all eventualities by taking with them their heavy war
horses, uncomfortably stabled in the holds of the larger
ships.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed southward along the coast, keeping the
land in sight. The two hundred ships of varying rates of
speed and handiness could not move in the ordered lines
of a modern naval armament, but streamed along in an
irregular procession, closing up when they anchored for
the night. From the North Foreland, with a favourable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
wind behind them, they put out into the open sea, and
steering eastward were out of sight of land for a few hours,
a more venturous voyage for these coasting craft than the
crossing of the Atlantic is for us to-day. It must have
been a trying experience for knight and yeoman, and they
must have felt that a great peril was past when the tops
of church towers and windmills showed above the horizon,
and then the low shore fringed with sandhills and the
green dykes came in sight.</p>

<p>Coasting along the shore north-eastwards, the fleet
reached a point to the north-west of Bruges, not far from
where the watering-place of Blankenberg now stands. It
had been ascertained from fishermen and coast-folk that
the French fleet was still at Sluys, and it was decided to
proceed no further without reconnoitring the enemy. The
larger ships anchored, the smaller were beached. The
fighting-men landed and camped on the shore to recover
from the distresses of their voyage, during which they
would have been cramped up in narrow quarters.</p>

<p>Instead of, like a modern admiral, sending some of his
lighter and swifter ships to take a look at the enemy, King
Edward arranged a cavalry reconnaissance, a simpler
matter for his knightly following. Some of the horses were
got ashore, and a party of knights mounted and rode over
the sandhills towards Sluys. They reached a point where,
without being observed by the enemy, they could get
a good view of the hostile fleet, and they brought back
news that made the King decide to attack next day.</p>

<p>The French fleet was commanded by two knights, the
Sieur de Kiriet and the Sieur de Bahuchet. Kiriet's name
suggests that he came of the Breton race that has given
so many good sailors and naval officers to France, so perhaps
he knew something of the sea. Associated with the
two French commanders there was an experienced fighting
admiral, a veteran of the wars of the Mediterranean,
Barbavera, who commanded the Genoese ships. Though
they had a slight superiority of numbers and more large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
ships than the English, Kiriet and Bahuchet were, as one
might expect from their prolonged inactivity, very wanting
in enterprise now that the crisis had come. They were
preparing to fight on the defensive. It was in vain that
the experienced commander Barbavera urged that they
should weigh anchor and fight the English in the open sea,
where numbers and weight would give them an advantage
that would be lost in the narrow waters of the Eede estuary.
They persisted in awaiting the attack.</p>

<p>The French fleet was anchored along the south shore of
the river-mouth, sterns to the land, its left towards the
river-mouth, its right towards the town of Sluys. The
vessel on the extreme left was an English ship of large size,
the "Great Cristopher," captured in the Channel in the
first days of the war. The ships were grouped in three
divisions&mdash;left, centre, and right. Kiriet and Bahuchet
adopted the same plan of battle that King Olaf had used
at Svold. The ships in each of the three divisions were
lashed together side by side, so that they could only be
boarded by the high narrow bows, and there was an
addition to the Norse plan, for inboard across the bows
barricades had been erected formed of oars, spars, and
planking, fastened across the forecastle decks. Behind
these barriers archers and Genoese cross-bowmen were
posted. There was a second line of archers in the fighting-tops,
for since the times of Norse warfare the masts had
become heavier, and now supported above the crossyard
a kind of crow's nest where two or three bowmen
could be stationed, with shields hung round them as a
parapet.</p>

<p>The fleet thus was converted into a series of three
long, narrow floating forts. It was an intelligible plan of
defence for a weak fleet against a strong one, but a hopeless
plan for an armament strong enough to have met its opponents
on the open sea, ship to ship. At Svold, Erik Jarl
had shown that such an array could be destroyed piecemeal
if assailed on an exposed flank, and at Sluys the left, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the "Great Cristopher" lay to seaward, positively invited
such an attack.</p>

<p>King Edward saw his advantage as soon as his knights
came back from their adventurous ride and told him
what they had seen, and he arranged his plans accordingly.
His great ships were to lead the attack, and concentrate
their efforts on the left of the French line. The rest were
to pass inside them and engage the enemy in front, on the
left, and centre. The enemy had by tying up his ships
made it impossible to come to the rescue of the left, even
if the narrow waters of the estuary would have allowed
him to deploy his force into line. The English would
have, and could not fail to keep, a local superiority from
the very outset on the left of the enemy, and once it came
to close quarters they would clear the French and Genoese
decks from end to end of the line, taking ship after ship.
While the attack developed the English archers would
prepare the way for it by thinning the ranks of their
enemies on the ships in the centre and then on the right.</p>

<p>At dawn on 24 June&mdash;the day of battle&mdash;the wind
was blowing fair into the mouth of the Eede, but the
tide was ebbing, and the attack could not be driven
home till it turned, and gave deep water everywhere
between the banks of the inlet. King Edward used the
interval to array his fleet and get it into position for the
dash into the river. His ships stood out to sea on the
starboard tack, a brave sight with the midsummer sun
shining on the white sails, the hundreds of banners glowing
with red, blue, white, and gold, the painted shields hanging
on poop and bulwark. On the raised bows and sterns of
the larger ships barons and knights and men-at-arms
stood arrayed in complete armour. The archers were
ranged along the bulwarks, or looked out from the crow's-nest-tops
over the swelling sails.</p>

<p>Old Barbavera must have longed to cut lashings, slip
cables, drift out on the tide, and meet the English in
the open, but he was in a minority of one against two.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
And now the tide was dead slack and began to turn,
and King Edward's trumpets gave the expected signal
for action. As their notes rang over the sea the shouting
sailors squared the yards and the fleet began to scud before
the wind for the river-mouth, where beyond the green
dykes that kept the entrance free a forest of masts bristled
along the bank towards Sluys.</p>

<p>The English came in with wind and tide helping them,
several ships abreast, the rest following each as quickly
as she might, like a great flock of sea-birds streaming
towards the shore. There could be no long ranging fire
to prelude the close attack. At some sixty yards, when
men could see each other's faces across the gap, the English
archers drew their bows, and the cloth-yard arrows began
to fly, their first target the "Great Cristopher" on the
flank of the line. Bolts from cross-bows came whizzing
back in reply. But, as at Crecy soon after, the long-bow
with its rapid discharge of arrows proved its superiority
over the slower mechanical weapon of the Genoese cross-bowmen.</p>

<p>But no time was lost in mere shooting. Two English
ships crashed into the bows and the port side of the "Cristopher,"
and with the cry of "St. George for England!"
a score of knights vied with each other for the honour
of being first on board of the enemy. The other ships
of the English van swung round bow to bow with the
next of the French line, grappled and fought to board
them. King Edward himself climbed over the bows of
a French ship, risking his life as freely as the youngest
of his esquires. Then for a while on the French left it
was a question of which could best handle the long, heavy
swords, made not for deft fencing work, but for sheer
hard hacking at helmet and breastplate.</p>

<p>Behind this fight on the flank, ship after ship slipped
into the river, but at first attacked only the left division
closely, those that had pushed furthest in opening with
arrow fire on the centre and leaving the right to look
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
helplessly on. The English archers soon cleared the
enemy's tops of their bowmen, and then from the English
masts shot coolly into the throng on the hostile decks,
their comrades at the bulwarks shooting over the heads
of those engaged in the bows. The English arrows inflicted
severe loss on the enemy, but the real business
was done by the close attack of the boarding-parties,
that cleared ship after ship from the left inwards, each
ship attacked in turn having to meet the knights and
men-at-arms from several of the English vessels.</p>

<p>But the French fought with determined courage, and
hour after hour went by as the attack slowly worked
its way along the line. The slaughter was terrible, for
in a sea-fight, as in the storming of a city wall, no quarter
was asked or given. The crews of the captured ships
were cut down as they fought, or driven over the stern
into the water, where, for the most part, their heavy
armour drowned them.</p>

<p>It was past noon, and the tide was turning when the
left and centre, the squadrons of Kiriet and Bahuchet,
were all captured. Then the attack raged round the
nearest vessels on the right, tall ships of the Genoese.
Most of these, too, were taken, but as the tide ran out
King Edward feared his large ships would ground in the
upper waters of the estuary, and the signal was given
to break off the attack, an order welcome even to the
weary victors.</p>

<p>Barbavera, with a few ships, got clear of the beaten
right wing and lay up near Sluys, while the English
plundered and burned some of their prizes and took the
best of them out to sea on the ebbing tide. In the night
the Genoese admiral slipped out to sea, and got safely
away. The French fleet had been utterly destroyed,
and the Genoese sailors had no intention of further risking
themselves in King Philip's quarrel. They thought only
of returning as soon as might be to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>King Edward went on to Ghent, after landing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
fighting-men, and sending his fleet to bring further forces
from England. Henceforth for many a long year he
might regard the Channel as a safe highway for men and
supplies for the war in France.</p>

<p>The victory of the English had cost them a relatively
trifling loss. The French losses are said to have been
nearly 30,000 men. Strange to say, among the English
dead were four ladies who had embarked on the King's
ship to join the Queen's Court at Ghent. How they were
killed is not stated. Probably they were courageous
dames whose curiosity led them to watch the fight from
the tall poop of the flagship as they would have watched
a tournament from the galleries of the lists, and there
the cross-bow bolts of the Genoese found them.</p>

<p>There is an old story that men feared to tell King
Philip the news of the disaster, and the Court jester broke
the tidings with a casual remark that the French must
be braver than the English, for they jumped into the
sea by scores, while the islanders stuck to their ships.
The defeat at sea prepared the way for other defeats
by land, and in these campaigns there appeared a new
weapon of war&mdash;rudely fashioned cannon of short range
and slow, inaccurate fire&mdash;the precursors of heavier artillery
that was to change the whole character of naval
warfare.</p>

<p>It was the coming of the cannon that inaugurated
the modern period. But before telling of battles in which
artillery played the chief part, we must tell of a decisive
battle that was a link between old and new. Lepanto&mdash;the
battle that broke the Turkish power in the Mediterranean&mdash;saw,
like the sea-fights of later days, artillery
in action, and at the same time oar-driven galleys fighting
with the tactics that had been employed at Salamis and
Actium, and knights in armour storming the enemy's
ships like Erik Jarl at Svold and King Edward at Sluys.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="title">
LEPANTO<br />
1571</p>


<p>The Turk has long been known as the "sick man
of Europe," and the story of the Ottoman Empire
for a hundred years has been a tale of gradual dismemberment.
Thus it is no easy matter for us to realize that
for centuries the Ottoman power was the terror of the
civilized world.</p>

<p>It was in 1358 that the Ottomans seized Gallipoli, on
the Dardanelles, and thus obtained their first footing
in Europe. They soon made themselves masters of Philippopolis
and Adrianople. A crusading army, gathered to
drive the Asiatic horde from Europe, was cut to pieces
by the Sultan Bajazet at Nicopolis in <span class="ins" title="1494">1396</span>. On the day
after the battle ten thousand Christian prisoners were
massacred before the Sultan, the slaughter going on
from daybreak till late in the afternoon. The Turk had
become the terror of Europe.</p>

<p>Constantinople was taken by Mahomet&nbsp;II in 1453,
and the Greek Empire came to an inglorious end. Then
for more than a century Austrians, Hungarians, and Poles
formed a barrier to the advance of the Asiatic power
into Central Europe.</p>

<p>But the Turks during this century became a maritime
power. They had conquered the Crimea and were masters
of the Black Sea. They had overrun Greece and most
of the islands of the Archipelago. They had threatened
Venice with their fleets, and had for a while a foothold
in Southern Italy. They took Rhodes from the Knights
of St. John, annexed Syria and Egypt, and the Sultan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of Constantinople was acknowledged as the Khalifa of
Islam, the representative of the Prophet by the Mohammedan
states of North Africa&mdash;Tripoli, Tunis, and
Morocco. In 1526 the victory of Mohacs made the Turks
masters of Hungary. They had driven a wedge deep into
Europe, and there was danger that their fleets would soon
hold the command of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>These fleets were composed chiefly of large galleys&mdash;lineal
descendants (so to say) of the ancient triremes.
There was a row of long oars on either side, but sail power
had so far developed that there were also one, two, even
three tall masts, each crossed by a long yard that carried
a triangular lateen sail. The base of the triangle lay
along the yard, and the apex was the lower corner of the
triangular sail, which could be hauled over to either
side of the ship, one end of the yard being hauled down
on the other side. The sail thus lay at an angle with
the line of the keel, with one point of the yard high above
the masthead, and by carrying the sheet tackle of the
point of the sail across the ship, and reversing the position
of the yard, the galley was put on one tack or the other.
Forward, pointing ahead, was a battery of two or more
guns, and there was sometimes a second but lighter battery
astern, to be used when the galley was escaping from a
ship of superior force. Turks, in the Eastern Mediterranean,
Moors in the West, recruited their crews of rowers by
capturing Christian ships and raiding Christian villages,
to carry off captives who could be trained to the oar.
This piracy, plundering, and slave-hunting went on in
the Mediterranean up to the first years of the nineteenth
century, when, after the Turks themselves had long
abandoned it, the sea rovers of the Barbary States in the
western waters of the inland sea still kept it up, and European
nations paid blackmail to the Beys of Tripoli, Tunis,
and Algiers to secure immunity for their ships and sailors.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries no part of
the Mediterranean was free from the raids of the Moslem
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
pirates. Such was the peril of the sea that ships used to
carry two sets of sails, one white for use by day, the
other black, in order to conceal their movements in the
darkness. Thousands of Christian slaves were always
wearing out their miserable lives in the galleys and prisons
of the Mohammedan ports. Isolated expeditions were
sometimes made by this or that Christian power for
their deliverance. Two religious orders were founded
to collect alms for their ransom, to minister to them in
their captivity, and to negotiate for their deliverance.
But all this was only a mitigation of the evil, and year
after year there went on the enslavement of Europeans,
men for the galleys, women for the harems.</p>

<p>One would have thought that all Europe would have
banded itself together to drive back the Turk from the
Danube and sweep the corsairs from the Mediterranean.
To their honour be it said that successive Popes
endeavoured to arouse the old crusading spirit, and
band civilized and Christian Europe together for an
enterprise that was to the advantage of all, and the neglect
of which was a lasting disgrace. But their efforts were
long defeated by the mutual quarrels and jealousies and
the selfish policy of the European powers. Venice and
Genoa long preferred to maintain peace with the Sultans,
in order to have the undisturbed monopoly of the Eastern
trade. France was too often the ally of the Turk, thanks
to her traditional rivalry with the House of Austria,
the rulers of the German Empire. The pressure of Turkish
armies on the Eastern frontiers of the Empire made it
impossible for the Emperors to use their full strength on
the Rhine or in North Italy.</p>

<p>Again and again Rome uttered the cry of alarm, and
the warning passed unheeded. But at last it was listened
to, when a new outburst of aggressive activity on the
part of the Turks for a while roused the maritime nations
of the Mediterranean from their lethargy, and then a
glorious page was added to the story of naval warfare.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>In the year 1566 Suleiman the Magnificent died. He
had conquered at Mohacs and besieged Vienna, enlarged
the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire on land, and made
its fleets the terror of the Mediterranean; but the year
before he died his pashas had failed disastrously in their
attempt on Malta, and his successor, Selim&nbsp;II (whom
Ottoman historians surname "the Drunkard"), was
reported to be a half-imbecile wretch, devoid of either
intelligence or enterprise. So Europe breathed more
freely. But while the "Drunkard" idled in his seraglio
by the Golden Horn, the old statesmen, generals, and
admirals, whom Suleiman had formed, were still living,
and Europe had lulled itself with false hopes of peace.</p>

<p>For the sake of their Eastern trade interests the Venetians
had as far as possible stood neutral in the wars between
Turk and Christian, and had long been in undisturbed
possession of Cyprus. For eighty years they had held it
under a treaty that recognized certain rights of the Sultan
to the island as a dependency of Egypt. They had stood
neutral while Suleiman took Rhodes and besieged Malta,
though on either occasion the intervention of the Venetian
fleet would have been a serious blow to the Ottoman
power. The Venetian Senate was therefore disagreeably
surprised when an envoy from Constantinople demanded
the evacuation of Cyprus, and announced that the Sultan
intended to exercise his full rights as sovereign of the
island. The armaments of the Republic were at a low
ebb, but Doge and Senate rejected the Ottoman demand,
and defied the menace of war that accompanied it.</p>

<p>The neutrality of Venice had been the chief obstacle
to the efforts of Pius&nbsp;V to form a league of the maritime
powers of Southern Europe against the common enemy
of Christendom. When, therefore, the Venetian ambassadors
applied to the Vatican for help, the Pope put
the limited resources of his own states at their disposal,
and exerted his influence to procure for them help from
other countries. Pius saw the possibility of at last forming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a league against the Turk, and was statesman enough to
perceive that a more effective blow would be struck
against them by attacking them on the sea than by gathering
a crusading army on the Theiss and the Danube.</p>

<p>His own galleys were prepared for service under the
orders of Prince Colonna, and a subsidy was sent to Venice
from the papal treasury to aid in the equipment of the
Venetian fleet. The papal envoys appealed to the Genoese
Republic, the Knights of Malta, and the Kings of France
and Spain to reinforce the fleets of Rome and Venice.
But France and Spain were more interested in their
own local ambitions and jealousies, and even Philip&nbsp;II
gave at first very limited help. With endless difficulty
a fleet of galleys was at last assembled, Maltese, Genoese,
Roman, Venetian, united under the command of Colonna.
By the time the Christian armament was ready a larger
Turkish fleet had appeared in the waters of Cyprus and
landed an army, which, under its protection, began the
siege of <span class="ins" title="Nicosis">Nicosia</span>. After long delays Colonna's fleet reached
Suda Bay in Crete, and joined a squadron of Venetian
galleys kept for guardship duties in Cretan waters.</p>

<p>Though Colonna was in nominal command, the fleet
was really controlled by a committee of the chiefs of its
various squadrons. There were endless councils of war,
and it is a trite saying that "councils of war do not fight."
Prudent caution is oftener the outcome of such debates
than daring enterprises. There was a time, in the first
days of September, when, if the Suda fleet had gone
boldly to the relief of Nicosia, it might have raised the
siege, for the Venetian garrison was making such a vigorous
defence that in order to press the siege the Turkish
pashas had stripped their fleet of thousands of fighting-men
to employ them in the trenches. But the golden
opportunity passed by, and when at last Colonna took his
galleys across to the coast of Asia Minor, Nicosia had
fallen, and the Turks had begun the siege of the other
Cypriote fortress, Famagusta.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Again there were divided counsels and pitiful irresolution.
The commanders of the various contingents
were brave men, veterans of the Mediterranean wars.
But the coalition lacked one determined leader who
could dominate the rest, decide upon a definite plan of
action, and put it into energetic execution. Time was
wasted till the bad weather began. Then the various
squadrons made their way to the ports where they were
to pass the winter. A squadron of the Venetians remained
in the Cretan ports. The rest dispersed to the harbours
of Italy and the Ionian islands.</p>

<p>The aged pontiff heard with bitter disappointment
that nothing had been accomplished. The news might
well have made even a younger man lose heart. But
with undaunted courage he devoted himself to forming
a more powerful combination for the great effort of the
coming summer.</p>

<p>It was all-important to secure the alliance of the King
of Spain, who was also ruler of Naples and Sicily. But
it was only after long negotiations and smoothing away
of endless jealousies between Spain and Venice, that at
last the treaty of the "Holy League" was signed by
the Republic of Venice, the King of Spain, and the Pope,
Pius&nbsp;V undertaking to bring in help from the minor
Princes and Republics of Italy and the Knights of Malta.</p>

<p>It was proposed that there should be a fleet of three
hundred ships, of which two hundred were to be galleys
and a hundred <i>navi</i>, that is full-rigged sailing-ships.
It was the first time that the sailing-ship had been given
so important a place in naval projects in the Mediterranean,
and this shows the change that was rapidly coming into
naval methods. The allies were jointly to raise a force
of 50,000 fighting-men, including 500 gunners.</p>

<p>Once the treaty was arranged preparations were pushed
forward, but again there were wearisome delays. It
was easy enough to build galleys. The arsenal of Venice
had once laid a keel at sunrise and launched the galley
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
before sunset. But to recruit the thousands of oarsmen
was a longer business. It was not till well into the summer
of 1571 that the armada of the Holy League began to assemble
at the appointed rendezvous, Messina. Meanwhile,
the Turks were pressing the siege of Famagusta, blockading
it by land and sea, and sapping slowly up to its walls.
The heroic commandant of the place, Antonio Bragadino,
a worthy son of Venice, made an active defence, retarding
by frequent sorties the progress of the enemy's siege works.</p>

<p>By the month of June the Turks had lost nearly 30,000
men, including those who fell victims to the fever that
raged in their camps. Bragadino's garrison had been
thinned by the enemy's fire, by sickness, and by semi-starvation,
and at the same time the magazines of ammunition
were nearly empty. Behind the yawning breaches
of the rampart an inner line of improvised defences had
been erected, and the citadel was still intact. If he had
had a little more flour and gunpowder, Bragadino would
have held out as stubbornly as ever. But with starving
men, empty magazines, and no sign of relief, he had to
accept the inevitable. He sent a flag of truce to Mustapha
Pasha, the Ottoman general, and relying on the impression
made by his stubborn defence, asked for generous terms.</p>

<p>Mustapha professed a chivalrous admiration for the
heroism of the Venetians. It was agreed that the garrison
should march out with the honours of war, and be transported
under a flag of truce to Crete and there set at
liberty. The Ottoman general pledged himself to protect
the people of Famagusta, and secure for them the free
exercise of their religion.</p>

<p>The war-worn soldiers marched out. Bragadino,
with the Venetian nobles, were received at Mustapha's
tent with every mark of honour. But no sooner had the
officers been separated from their men, and these divided
into small parties, than all were made prisoners, bound,
and robbed of all their personal property. The Turks
had often shown remorseless cruelty after victory, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
they generally observed the terms of a capitulation honourably.
Mustapha's conduct was an unexampled case of
treachery and barbarity.</p>

<p>The Venetian soldiers were sent on board the Turkish
galleys and chained to their oars as slaves. Bragadino
saw his officers beheaded before the Pasha's tent. He
might have saved his life by becoming a renegade, but
he was incapable of such apostasy and treason. The
barbarian, in whose power he was, invented new torments
for his victim. Bragadino had his ears and nose cut off,
and thus mutilated he was paraded round the Turkish
army, and then rowed in a boat through the fleet, and
everywhere greeted with insult and mockery. Then
Mustapha sentenced his prisoner to be flayed alive. The
torture had hardly begun when he expired, dying the
death of a hero and a martyr. Mustapha sent to Selim
the Drunkard as trophies of the conquest of Cyprus the
heads of the Venetian nobles and the skin of Bragadino
stuffed with straw. The news of the fall of Famagusta
and the horrors that followed it did not reach the allied
fleet till long after it had sailed from Messina.</p>

<p>But even during the period of preparation there were
tidings that might well have inspired the leaders of the
League with a new energy. The danger from the East
was pressing. In the spring the Ottoman fleet in the
waters of Cyprus had been reinforced with new galleys
from the arsenal of Constantinople, and a squadron
of Algerine corsairs under the renegade Pasha Ulugh Ali,
one of the best of the Turkish admirals. Thus strengthened,
the fleet numbered some two hundred and fifty sail.
Even before Famagusta fell Mustapha detached powerful
squadrons which harried the Greek archipelago, and then
rounding the capes of the Morea, made prizes of peaceful
traders and raided villages along the western shores of
Greece and in the Ionian islands.</p>

<p>During the period of the Turkish power Europe was
saved again and again from grave danger, because the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Ottoman Sultans and the Pashas of Barbary never seem
to have grasped the main principles of maritime warfare.
They had no wide views. Most of the men who commanded
for them on the sea had the spirit of pirates and
buccaneers rather than of admirals. They put to sea
to harry the trade of the Christian states and to raid their
coast villages, and so secure prizes, plunder, and slaves.
They frittered away their strength on these minor enterprises.
Again and again occasions offered, when to concentrate
their naval forces for a series of campaigns that
would sweep the Christian fleets one by one from the
sea would have made them masters of the Mediterranean,
placed its commerce and its coasts at their mercy, and
opened the way for a career of conquest, but they allowed
these opportunities to escape.</p>

<p>The peril that menaced European civilization in 1571
was that at last the Moslem powers of the Mediterranean
were actually combining their sea forces for a great
effort of maritime conquest. Their operations were still
delayed by their traditional disposition to indulge in
plundering raids, or to wait for the fall of a blockaded
fortress, instead of making the destruction of the opposing
sea power their first object. If the pashas of Selim's
fleets had really understood their business, they might
have destroyed the Christian squadrons in detail before they
could effect their concentration in the waters of Messina.
But the Turkish admirals let the opportunity escape them
during the long months when the "Holy League" was
being formed and its fleets made ready for action.</p>

<p>That the danger was met by the organization of a
united effort to break the Moslem power on the sea was
entirely due to the clear-sighted initiative and the persistent
energy of the aged Pius&nbsp;V. He had fully realized
that the naval campaign of 1570 had been paralysed
by the Christian fleet being directed, not by one vigorous
will, but by the cautious decisions of a permanent council
of war. He insisted on the armament of 1571 being under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the direction of one chief, and exercising his right as
chief of the League, Pius&nbsp;V had to select the commander
of its forces; he named as captain-general of the Christian
armada Don Juan of Austria.</p>

<p>Don Juan was then a young soldier, twenty-four years
of age. He was the son of the Emperor Charles&nbsp;V and
his mistress, Barbara Blomberg of Ratisbon. His boyhood
had been passed, unknown and unacknowledged by
his father, in a peasant household in Castille. As a youth
he had been adopted by a noble family of Valladolid.
Then Philip&nbsp;II had acknowledged him as his half-brother,
and given him the rank of a Spanish Prince. He studied
at Alcala, having for his friends and companions Alexander
Farnese, the "Great Captain" of future years, and
the unfortunate Don Carlos. Don Juan's rank gave him
early the opportunity of displaying in high command
his marked genius for war. He was employed in expeditions
in the Mediterranean, and directed the suppression
of the Moorish revolt in Granada in 1570. He was then
named "Capitan-General del Mar"&mdash;High Admiral of
the Spanish fleets. Young as he was when Pius&nbsp;V appointed
him commander-in-chief of the forces of the Holy
League, his services by land and sea, as well as his princely
rank, gave him the necessary prestige to enable him to
command even older generals like Marco Antonio Colonna,
the leader of the papal and Italian forces, and the veteran
Sebastian Veniero, who directed those of Venice.</p>

<p>During the period of concentration it was Veniero who
had the most difficult problem to solve. The Venetian
fleet had separated into two divisions at the close of the
campaign of 1570. The weaker wintered in the harbours
of Crete. The stronger detachment passed the winter
at Corfu, in the Ionian islands. In the early summer of
1571 Veniero took command at Corfu, and occupied
himself with preparing the fleet for sea, and reinforcing
it with new galleys from the arsenal of Venice, and newly
raised drafts of sailors, rowers, and fighting-men. Before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
his preparations were complete, the vanguard of the
Turkish armada, continually reinforced from the East,
appeared on the western coasts of Greece. To attack them
with the force he had at hand would be to court destruction.
Ulugh Ali, who commanded the vanguard of the enemy,
was perhaps the best-hated of the Moslem admirals.
A Calabrese fisherman, he had been captured as a young
man by one of the Barbary corsairs, and spent some miserable
years chained as a galley-slave at an oar. At last his
endurance broke down, and he escaped from his misery
by becoming a Mohammedan. Under his new name he
rose rapidly to command, enriched himself by successful
piracy, and before long won himself the rank of a Pasha
and a vice-royalty in North Africa. But, happily for
Europe at large, though unfortunately for many a village
along the shores of Greece and Illyria, Ulugh Ali as admiral
of the Turkish fleets remained still a pirate, with the fixed
idea that a plundering cruise was better than a naval
campaign. Had the renegade been more admiral than
pirate, he had an opportunity of changing the course of
history in that early summer of 1571.</p>

<p>His fleet cruising off the coasts of Epirus held a central
strategic position in relation to the still dispersed Christian
fleets. The papal contingents on the western shores
of Italy and the Spanish fleets in the ports of the Two
Sicilies, or coasting from Spain by the Gulf of Lyons
and the Italian shores, were, it is true, beyond his immediate
reach, but he could easily lop off one important
branch of the triple League by cutting off the Venetians.
The squadron from Crete must pass him to the southward;
the more important contingent from Corfu must pass
between him and Southern Italy in narrow seas where
he could hardly fail to bring it to action, and if it fought,
the chances were he would overwhelm it. Or he might
attack it at Corfu, or drive it from the island back upon
Venice. If he had good luck he might hope to be in time
even after this to strike a blow also at the Cretan squadron.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>But he thought only of plundering and burning along
the coasts, carrying off crowds of prisoners, some of
whom were at once added to his crews of chained rowers.
Veniero at Corfu had to steel his heart against entreaties
to come to the rescue of the mainland coast population.
He could not save them, and he dared not destroy his
fleet in a hopeless effort. He must seize the opportunity
while the Turks were occupied with their raids to sail
unopposed to Messina. He decided even to risk the loss
of Corfu. He was acting on the sound principle that in
war all minor objects must be sacrificed to the chief end
of the campaign. But he could not be sure that in obeying
his original orders, and taking his fleet to Messina, he
was not in another way risking his position, perhaps his life.
He was leaving to the Turks the temporary command
of the Adriatic. After he left Corfu they carried fire and
sword along the Illyrian coast. There was a panic in
Venice, and the city of the lagoons made hasty preparations
for defence. But Veniero's action was soon justified.
The news that the Christian armada was assembled at
Messina alarmed Ulugh Ali into abandoning any further
enterprises in the Adriatic, and his squadrons withdrew
to join the concentration of the Turkish fleets at the
entrance of the Gulf of Corinth.</p>

<p>It was not till 23 August that the Spanish Prince arrived
at Messina, took command of the assembled fleets,
and proceeded at once to organize his forces, and issued
his sailing and battle orders.</p>

<p>Nearly three hundred ships crowded the harbour of
Messina. There were three fleets, the Italian squadrons
under the papal admiral Colonna, the Venetian fleet,
and the fleet of Philip&nbsp;II formed of the ships of Spain and
Naples. The main force of the three fleets was made up
of galleys. But there were also six galleasses and some
seventy frigates, the former depending chiefly, the latter
entirely, on sail power for propulsion. The frigate was,
in the following century and almost up to our time, what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the cruiser is in the armoured navies of to-day. But in
the Mediterranean fleets of the fifteenth century the
<i>frigata</i> represented only an early type, out of which
the frigate of later days was developed. She was a small
sailing-ship, sometimes a mere yacht, armed only with
a few light guns. The frigates were used to convey stores,
the swifter among them being often employed as dispatch
boats. Depending entirely on the wind, it was not always
easy for them to accompany a fleet of galleys. Don Juan
gave up the idea of making them part of his fighting fleet.
It was still the period of the oar-driven man-of-war,
though the day of sails was close at hand.</p>

<p>The six galleasses represented a new type, a link between
the oared ships of the past and the sailing fleets of the
immediate future. They were heavy three-masted ships,
with rounded bows, and their upper works built with an
inward curve, so that the width across the bulwarks amidships
was less than that of the gundeck below. The
frames of warships were built on these lines till after
Nelson's days. This "tumble home" of the sides, as it
was called, was adopted to bring the weight of the broadside
guns nearer the centre line of the ship, and so lessen
the leverage and strain on her framework. The guns had
first been fired over the bulwarks, but at a very early
date port-holes were adopted for them. The galleass
had a high forecastle and poop, each with its battery
of guns, pointing ahead, astern, and on each side. Other
guns were mounted on the broadsides in the waist
of the ship; and to command the main-deck, in case an
enemy's boarders got possession of it, lighter guns were
mounted on swivels at the back of the forecastle and on
the forepart of the poop. Compared to the low, crowded
galley, the galleass was a roomy and much more seaworthy
ship. She was generally a slow sailer, but in order
to enable her to make some progress, even in calms or
against a head wind, and so work with a fleet of galleys,
she had a rowers' deck, under her main or gundeck, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
on each side twelve or fifteen oars of enormous length,
each worked by several men. She had the drawbacks
of most compromises. She could not sail as well as the
frigate, and her speed with the oar was much less than
that of the galley. But the gain was that she could be
used as a floating battery, carrying many more guns than
the few pieces mounted in the galley's bows. The galleass's
guns were high above the water, and the galleys
dreaded their plunging fire. Each of Don Juan's six
galleasses carried some thirty guns of various calibres,
and to defend their high sides against an attack by boarders,
their fighting-men were chiefly arquebusiers.</p>

<p>In order to fuse the triple fleet of the Allies into one
armada, and to avoid the risk of international jealousies,
Don Juan proceeded to form his galleys into five squadrons,
each made up of ships selected from the three fleets, so
that none of these divisions could claim to act only for
Rome, or Spain, or Venice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that instead of choosing one
of the large sailing-vessels as his flagship, Don Juan displayed
his flag, the standard of the League, from the masthead
of the largest of the Spanish galleys, the "Reale,"
a splendid ship built for the Viceroy of Catalonia three
years before. She had sixty oars, a battery of guns pointing
forward through a breastwork in the bow, and another
gun on her high poop, pointing over her stern, which
was adorned with elaborate wood carvings, the work of
Vasquez of Seville, one of the most famous sculptors
of the day. She had a crew of 300 rowers and 400 fighting-men.
In the battle-line two other great galleys were
to lie to right and left of the "Reale," on her starboard,
the flagship of Colonna, the papal admiral, and to port that
of Veniero the Venetian, flying the lion banner of St. Mark.
Next to these were the galleys of the Princes of Parma and
Urbino. On the extreme right of the centre was the post
of the flagship of the Knights of Malta, commanded by the
Grand Master Giustiniani. All the galleys of the central
squadron flew blue pennons as their distinguishing flag.</p>

<p>The vanguard and the right flew green triangular flags.
When the line was formed Cardona and his seven galleys
were to take post on the left or inner flank of the right
division. Doria, the Genoese admiral, was on the extreme
right.</p>

<p>The left flew yellow pennons. Its admiral was the
Venetian Barbarigo, a veteran of many a hard-fought
campaign.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz, the admiral of the reserve squadron, was
posted in the middle of his line, flying his flag on board
the "Capitana" or flagship of the Neapolitan squadron.
All the flagships had as a distinctive mark a long red
pennon at the foremast-head.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight thousand fighting-men were embarked
on the fleet. The Italian soldiers were the most numerous,
then came the Spaniards. There were about 2000 of
other nationalities, chiefly Germans. The Venetian galleys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
were rather short of fighting-men, and to remedy this
weakness Veniero, though with some reluctance, consented
to receive on board of them detachments of Don
Juan's Spanish infantry.</p>

<p>On almost every ship there were serving a number
of young gentlemen volunteers. To give a list of their
names and of the commanders of galleasses and galleys
and detachments of troops embarked would be to draw
up a roll of the historic names of Italy and Spain. Lepanto
might well be described as not only the closing battle
of crusading days, but the last battle of the age of chivalry.
And, strange to say, on board of one of Colonna's galleys,
acting as second in command of its fighting-men, there
was a young Spaniard who was to "laugh Europe out of
its chivalry"&mdash;Don Miguel Cervantes de Saavedra,
author of "Don Quixote" some thirty years later.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week of September the fleet
was ready for sea, but the start was delayed by bad weather.
For several days a storm raged in the Straits of Messina,
accompanied by thunder and lightning and torrents of
rain. At length, on the 14th, the sky cleared and the
sea went down. Next day Don Juan sent off the squadron
of frigates under the command of Don Cesar d'Avalos,
with orders to proceed to Taranto and await the main
body of the fleet there.</p>

<p>At sunrise on the 16th the great fleet left Messina.
The "Reale" led the way; the tall galleasses were towed
out by the galleys. It took some hours for the whole
armada to clear the harbour, then, on the admiral's
signal, they set their sails, and with wind and oar steered
south-westward across the straits. The first day's voyage
was only a few miles. Don Juan was taking the opportunity
of reviewing his fleet, and testing his arrangements
for its formation. Each captain had his written orders
giving his position when under way and in the line of
battle. It was in this formation the fleet anchored along
the Italian coast beyond Reggio, on a front of five miles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Next day the fleet rounded Cape Spartivento, the toe
of Italy, and after an attempt to continue the voyage
on the 19th was forced by bad weather to put back and
anchor under shelter of the land for some twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>As the weather improved, Don Juan decided not to
coast round the Gulf by Taranto, but to lay his course
from Cape Colonna for Cape Santa Maria (the heel of
Italy), and then across the opening of the Adriatic to
Corfu. A frigate was sent to inform D'Avalos of the
change of plans, and the armada, helped by a favouring
wind, stood out to sea and for a while lost sight of land.</p>

<p>It was known that the Turkish fleet had concentrated
in or near the opening of the Gulf of Corinth. It might
also have put to sea, and Don Juan took precautions in
view of a possible encounter during his voyage. Cardona,
with his seven swift galleys of the vanguard, was directed
to keep twenty miles ahead during the daytime, closing
in to a distance of only eight miles at sunset, and increasing
the interval again at dawn. The three squadrons of the
main body appear to have been formed each in line ahead,
the leading ships, those of the admirals, at the head of
each squadron, with such lateral intervals between the
columns that line of battle could be formed, by the ships
coming up to right and left of their flagships. Santa
Cruz with the reserve acted as a rearguard, and was to
assist any vessel that might be in difficulties. The rear
ship of each squadron was to display a large lantern at
the mast-head after dark. The admiral's ship was distinguished
by three large lanterns.</p>

<p>Forty galleys were detached to bring reinforcements
of infantry from Taranto and Gallipoli. Four swift galleys
under the command of Gil d'Andrada were sent on in
advance to obtain information of the Ottoman fleet.</p>

<p>From Cape Santa Maria the course was set for the
Ionian Islands. On the morning of 24 September, through
the driving rain that accompanied a heavy thunderstorm,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the look-outs of the vanguard could distinguish the chain
of islands north of Corfu, the islets of Merlera, Fano, and
Samothraki, which with the reefs that almost connect
them form a natural breakwater. The wind and sea were
rising, and the fleet anchored inside the shelter of the
islands and reefs. It was not until 26 September that it
reached at length the harbour of Corfu. It had taken
ten days to complete a passage that the tourist from
Messina to Corfu now covers in a single day.</p>

<p>At Corfu the commandant of the fortress had terrible
tales to tell of Ulugh Ali's raid on the island, and the
horrors that the Turks had perpetrated in the villages,
which now presented a scene of ruin and desolation. Gil
d'Andrada rejoined the fleet there. He had not seen the
Turkish armament, but he had obtained news of it from
coasters and fishermen. He estimated from these reports
that it was inferior in numbers to the Christian fleet,
and he had learned that, as if conscious of its weakness,
it had taken shelter well up the Gulf of Corinth, in the
Bay of Lepanto. The bay lies eastward of the point
where the gulf contracts into a narrow strait between
the "Castles of Roumelia" and "the Morea," then
held by the Turks. The defences were of such strength
that at the time the strait was popularly known as "the
Little Dardanelles."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was thought that it would be
hopeless for the allied fleet to attempt to force the passage.</p>

<p>Four days were spent in the waters of Corfu, and 4000
troops of the garrison were embarked. Gil d'Andrada's
four galleys had again been sent away to reconnoitre
the enemy. On 30 September the weather was fine and
the wind favourable, so Don Juan led his fleet from Corfu
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to the Bay of Gomenizza, thirty miles to the south-east,
on the coast of Albania. The galeasses guarded
the entrance of the bay; the galleys were moored inside
it, bow on to the shore, with their guns thus directed
towards it. Working parties were landed under their
protection to obtain supplies of wood and water. On
2 October some Spaniards engaged in the work were
surprised and made prisoners by Turkish irregulars,
Albanian horsemen, who carried them off to the headquarters
of Ali Pasha, the Turkish generalissimo, at
Lepanto.</p>

<p>Gil d'Andrada rejoined at Gomenizza with news that
the Turkish fleet was not more than 200 strong; that
pestilence had broken out among its fighting-men, and
that many of the galleys were undermanned. This encouraged
Don Juan to attempt an attack upon it as it
lay in the gulf.</p>

<p>But Ali Pasha had also received reports that led him
to underrate the strength of the Christian armada, and
so induced him to put out to sea in search of it. Twice
he had reconnoitred the allied fleet. Before Don Juan
arrived at Messina, Ulugh Ali had sent one of his
corsairs, Kara Khodja, to cruise in Sicilian waters.
The corsair painted every part of his ship a dead black,
and one dark night, under black sails, he slipped into
Messina harbour. The utter daring of his enterprise
assisted him. Gliding like a ghost about the roadstead,
unmarked and unchallenged, he counted galleys, galleasses,
and frigates, and brought back an under-estimate
of the allied strength, only because the fleet was not yet
all assembled. He repeated his exploit while the fleet
lay in the waters of Corfu. He could not approach so
closely as at Messina, but what he saw led him to believe
it was no stronger than when he first reconnoitred it.
When Ali Pasha questioned the prisoners taken at Gomenizza,
using torture to make them answer him, he thought
their admissions confirmed Kara Khodja's reports. So
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
he decided to come out of Lepanto and attack the allied
armada.</p>

<p>Thus each fleet believed the other to be inferior in
strength, and consequently desired an early engagement.
The Turkish fleet was made up of 210 galleys and 64
galliots and smaller craft, 274 sail in all, and its commander,
Ali Pasha, was one of the veteran admirals of Suleiman's
victorious days; 25,000 soldiers had been embarked
under the Seraskier, or General, Pertev Pasha. Ali had
organized his fleet in four divisions, centre, right wing,
left wing, and reserve. All the ships had oars as well
as sails, and though Ali had no huge floating batteries,
like the six galleasses of Don Juan's fleet, the Turkish
admiral could match the Christians with galley for galley,
and have a surplus of 8 galleys and 66 smaller craft.
Of these the 44 galliots were almost as useful as the galleys.
Unlike the latter, which had two and often three masts,
the galliot had only one, and was smaller in size. But
the Turkish galliots, mostly belonging to the piratical
states of North Africa, were as large as many of the Christian
galleys of the second class; they could sail well,
and they were manned by crews of fighting-men that had
a long record of piratical warfare.</p>

<p>The fifty galleys of the right wing were ships from
Egypt, the ports of Asia Minor, and the arsenal of Constantinople,
united under the command of Mohammed
Chuluk Bey, Governor of Alexandria, known among the
Christian sailors of the Mediterranean as Mohammed
Scirocco. The centre, commanded by Ali in person, was
made up of galleys from Rhodes and the Greek islands,
and from Constantinople and Gallipoli, and the Tripolitan
squadron under Djaffir Agha, Governor of Tripoli. The
left under Ulugh Ali, the Viceroy of Algiers, included ships
from Constantinople, Asia Minor, Syria, and the ports
of North-west Africa. The reserve, chiefly composed
of small craft, was under the command of Murad Dragut
of Constantinople.</p>

<p>There were a good many Greek and Calabrese renegades
among the captains of the galleys, but the Syrians and
the mixed Arab race of Alexandria had learned the ways
of the sea; some even of the Turks were good sailors,
and the men of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers had made
the sea their element. The thousands of rowers, who
provided the propelling power of the galleys, were for
the most part Christian slaves, chained to their heavy
oars, by which they slept when the fleet anchored, living
a life of weary labour, often half starved, always badly
clothed, so that they suffered from cold and wet. Death
was the immediate penalty of any show of insubordination,
and the whip of their taskmasters kept them to their
work. There were men of all classes among them, sailors
taken from prizes, passengers who had the bad luck to
be on board captured ships, fishermen and tillers of the
soil carried off in coast raids. They were short-lived,
for their masters did not spare them, and considered it
a more economic policy to work the rowers to the utmost
and replace them by other captures when they broke
down.</p>

<p>The oarsmen of the allied fleet had also a hard lot,
but not as bad as that of Ali Pasha's galley-slaves, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
in the Christian fleet there was a considerable proportion
of men hired for the campaign. But there was also a servile
element, Turks taken prisoner in previous campaigns
and chained to the oar in reprisal for the treatment of
Christian captives by Ottoman commanders, and a considerable
number of what we should now call convicts
sentenced to hard labour, a rough lot of murderers, brigands,
thieves, and the like. It must be remembered that in
most European countries the sentence for such offences
would have been death. The convict galley-slaves of
Don Juan's fleet were encouraged by the prospect of
winning either complete pardon or a remission of part of
their sentences if there was a victory, and to enable them
to co-operate in winning it, they were told that they
would be freed from their chains and armed when the
day of battle came.</p>

<p>The 25,000 fighting-men of Ali Pasha's fleet were chiefly
militia. There were only a few thousand of the formidable
Janissaries. And among the small arms of the Turkish
fleet there were more bows and arrows than muskets.
Don Juan had, on the other hand, a considerable number
of arquebusiers on his ships. He had the further advantage
that while even the largest of the Turkish galleys had
only low bulwarks, the galleys of the allied fleet were
provided with <i>pavesades</i>, large bucklers and shields,
to be fitted along the bulwarks when clearing for action,
and also permanent cross barriers to prevent a raking
fire fore and aft.</p>

<p>When Ali left the roadstead of Lepanto, and brought
his fleet out from behind the batteries of the "Little
Dardanelles," he believed he had such a marked superiority
over the allied fleet that victory was a certainty, and he
expected to find Don Juan either at Gomenizza or in the
waters of the Ionian Islands. Pertev Pasha and several
of the admirals had opposed Ali's decision, and had urged
him either to remain at Lepanto, or run out of the gulf,
round the Morea, and wait in the eastern seas for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
campaign of next year. Their reason for this advice
was that many of the fighting-men were new levies unused
to the sea. But Ali's self-confidence made him reject
this prudent counsel.</p>

<p>On 2 October, Don Juan had made up his mind to leave
Gomenizza, enter the Gulf of Corinth, and risk an attack
on the passage of the Little Dardanelles. Accordingly
in the afternoon he gave orders that the fleet should
prepare to sail at sunrise next day. During the long delay
in the island waters belated news came that Famagusta
had fallen on 18 August, and with the news there was a
terrible story of the horrors that had followed the broken
capitulation. The news was now six weeks old, and this
meant that the whole of the enemy's fleet might be concentrated
in the Gulf of Corinth, but after the disasters
of Cyprus an attempt must be made to win a victory
against all or any odds.</p>

<p>At sunrise the armada streamed out of the Bay of
Gomenizza, and sped southwards with oar and sail. The
Gulf of Arta was passed, and the admirals were reminded
not of the far-off battle that saw the flight of the Egyptian
Queen and the epoch-making victory of Augustus C&aelig;sar,
but of a sea-fight in the same waters only a few years ago
that had ended in dire disaster to the Christian arms.
Then through the hours of darkness the fleet worked its
way past the rock-bound shores of Santa Maura, whose
cliffs glimmered in the moonlight. The roar of the breakers
at their base warned the pilots to give them good sea
room. In the grey of the morning the peaks and ridges
of Ithaca and Cephalonia rose out of the haze upon the
sea, and soon after sunrise the fleet was moving through
the narrow strait between the islands.</p>

<p>In the strait there were shelter and smooth water, but
the wind was rising, backing from north-west to west,
and raising a sea outside Cephalonia that sent a heavy
swell sweeping round its southern point and into the
opening of the narrows. As the leading ships reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the mouth of the strait Don Juan did not like the look
of the weather, and decided to anchor in the Bay of Phiscardo,
a large opening in the Cephalonian shore just inside
the strait.</p>

<p>For two days the fleet lay weather-bound in the bay.
During one of these days of storm Kara Khodja, the
Algerine, tried again to reconnoitre the fleet, but was
driven off by the guardships at the entrance of the strait.</p>

<p>On 6 October the wind shifted to the east and the
sea began to go down. Don Juan refused to wait any
longer. The fleet put to sea, under bare masts, and,
rowing hard against the wind and through rough water,
it worked its way slowly across to the sheltered waters
on the mainland coast between it and the islands of Curzolari.
Here the fleet anchored for the night, just outside
the opening of the Gulf of Corinth. Not twenty
miles away up the gulf lay the Turkish fleet, for Ali had
brought it out of the Bay of Lepanto, and anchored in the
Bay of Calydon.</p>

<p>When the sun rose on the 7th, the wind was still contrary,
blowing from the south-east. But at dawn the ships
were under way, and moving slowly in long procession
between the mainland and the islands that fringe the
coast. There was a certain amount of straggling. It was
difficult to keep the divisions closed up, and the tall
galleasses especially felt the effect of the head wind, and
some of the galleys had to assist them by towing.</p>

<p>As the ships of the vanguard began to clear the channel
between Oxia Island and Cape Scropha, and the wide
expanse of water at the entrance of the Gulf of Corinth
opened before them, the look-outs reported several ships
hull down on the horizon to the eastward, the sun shining
on their white sails, that showed like flecks of cloud on
the sea-line.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The signal was sent back, "Enemy in sight," for the
number of sails told it must be a fleet, and could be none
other than that of Ali Pasha. The allied squadrons began
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
to clear for action, and Don Juan displayed for the first
time the consecrated banner sent him by Pius&nbsp;V, a large
square flag embroidered with the crucifix and the figures
of Saints Peter and Paul.</p>

<p>It was an anxious time for the Christian admiral. His
fleet, now straggling for miles along the coast, had to
close up, issue from the channel, round Cape Scropha,
and form in battle array in the open water to the eastward.
If the Turks, who had the wind to help them,
came up before this complex operation was completed,
he risked being beaten in detail.</p>

<p>While the fleet was still working its way through the
channel, Don Juan had sent one of the Roman pilots,
Cecco Pisani forward in a swift galley to reconnoitre.
Pisani landed on Oxia, climbed one of its crags, and from
this lofty outlook counted 250 sail in the enemy's fleet,
which was coming out along the north shore of the gulf,
the three main squadrons abreast, the reserve astern of
them. Returning to the "Reale,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the pilot gave a
guarded report to Don Juan, fearing to discourage the
young commander now that battle was inevitable, but
to his own admiral, the veteran Colonna, he spoke freely.
"Signor," he said, "you must put out all your claws,
for it will be a hard fight."</p>

<p>Then the wind suddenly fell and the sea became calm
as a lake. The Turks were seen to be furling their now
useless sails. The rapidity with which the man&#0339;uvre was
simultaneously executed by hundreds of ships excited
the admiration of the Christians. It showed the enemy
had well-disciplined and practised crews. But at the
same time the fact that at a crisis, when every moment
gained was priceless, the Turks had lost the fair wind,
convinced the allies that Heaven was aiding them, and
gave them confidence in the promises of their chaplains,
grey-cowled Franciscans and black-robed Dominicans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
who were telling them that the prayers of Christendom
would assure them a victory. Their young chief, Don
Juan, left the "Reale" and embarked in a swift brigantine,
in which he rowed along the forming line of the fleet.
Clad in complete armour he stood in the bow holding up
a crucifix, and as he passed each galley he called on officers
and men to spare no effort in the holy cause for which
they were about to fight. Then he returned to his post
on the poop of the "Reale," which was in the centre of
the line, with several other large galleys grouped around
her. As each ship was pulled into her fighting position,
the Christian galley-slaves were freed from the oar and
given weapons with which to fight for the common cause
and their own freedom.</p>

<p>It was intended that the galleys of the left, centre,
and right should form one long line, with the six galleasses
well out in front of them, two before each division. These
were to break the force of the Turkish onset with their
cannon. But when the long line of the enemy's galleys
came rushing to the onset, Don Juan's battle array was
still incomplete. Barbarigo's flagship was on the extreme
left under the land. His division had formed upon this
mark, "dressing by the left," as a soldier would say.
The tall galleasses of two gallant brothers, the Venetians
Ambrogio and Antonio Bragadino, kinsmen of the hero
of Famagusta, lay well out in front of the left division.
All the ships had their sails furled and the long yards
hauled fore and aft. Don Juan had formed up the centre
division, two more galleasses out in front, the "Reale"
in the middle of the line, the galleys of Veniero and Colonna
to right and left, and two selected galleys lying astern,
covering the intervals between them and the flagship.
Only a few oars were being used to keep the ships in their
stations. So far so good, but the rest of the allied fleet
was still coming up. The reserve was only issuing from
the channel behind Cape Scropha, and Doria was leading
the right division into line, with his two galleasses working
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
up astern, where their artillery would be useless. Thus
when the battle began not much more than half of the
Christian armada was actually in line. But for the sudden
calm the position would have been even worse.</p>

1. allies forming line of battle&mdash;turks advancing to attack</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>It was almost noon when the battle began. The first
shots were fired by the four galleasses, as the long line of
Ottoman galleys came sweeping on into range of their
guns. Heavy cannon, such as they carried, were still
something of a novelty in naval war, and the Turks had
a dread of these tall floating castles that bristled with
guns, from which fire, smoke, and iron were now hurled
against them. One of the first shots crashed into the
deck of Ali Pasha's flagship, scattering destruction as
it came. The Turkish line swayed and lost its even array.
Some ships hesitated, others crowded together in order
to pass clear of the galleasses. Daring captains, who
ventured to approach with an idea of boarding them,
shrank back under the storm of musketry that burst
from their lofty bulwarks. The Turkish fleet surged
past the galleasses, broken into confused masses of ships,
with wide intervals between each squadron, as a stream
is divided by the piles of a bridge.</p>

<p>This disarray of the Turkish attack diminished the fire
their bow-guns could bring to bear on the Christian line,
for the leading galleys masked the batteries of those
that followed. Along the allied left and centre, lying in
even array bows to the attack, the guns roared out in a
heavy cannonade. But then as the Ottoman bows came
rushing through the smoke, and the fleets closed on each
other, the guns of the galleys were silent. For a few
moments the fight had been like a modern battle, with
hundreds of guns thundering over the sea. Now it was
a fight like Salamis or Actium, except for the sharp reports
of musketry in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and the cannon of the galleasses
making the Turkish galleys their mark when they could
fire into the mass without danger to their friends.</p>

<p>The first to meet in close conflict were Barbarigo's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
division on the allied left and Mohammed Scirocco's
squadron, which was opposed to it on the Turkish right.
The Egyptian Pasha brought his own galley into action
on the extreme flank bow to bow with the Venetian
flagship, and some of the lighter Turkish galleys, by working
through the shallows between Barbarigo and the land,
were able to fall on the rear of the extreme left of the line,
while the larger galleys pressed the attack in front. The
Venetian flagship was rushed by a boarding-party of
Janissaries, and her decks cleared as far as the mainmast.
Barbarigo, fighting with his visor open, was mortally
wounded with an arrow in his face, and was carried below.
But his nephew Contarini restored the fight, and with
the help of reinforcements from the next galley drove
the boarders from the decks of the flagship. Contarini
was mortally wounded in the midst of his success. But
two of his comrades, Nani and Porcia, led a rush of
Venetians and Spaniards on to Mohammed Scirocco's
flagship, whose decks were swept by the fire of the arquebusiers
before the charge of swords and pikes burst over
her bows. The onset was irresistible. The Turks were
cut down, stabbed, hurled overboard, Mohammed himself
being killed in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>

<p>By the time the great galley of Alexandria was thus
captured the landward wings of the two fleets were mingled
together in a confused fight, in which there was little
left of the original order. There was more trace of a line
on the allied or Christian side. The Turks had not broken
through them, but they had swung round, somewhat
forcing Mohammed's galleys towards the shore. When
the standard of the Egyptian admiral was hauled down
by the victorious Venetians, and the rowers suddenly
ceased to be slaves and fraternized with the conquerors,
some of the captains on the Turkish right lost heart,
drove their galleys aground in the shallows and deserted
them for the shore, where they hoped to find refuge among
friends. On Don Juan's left, though the fighting continued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in a fierce m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of ships locked together, and with
crews doing wild work with loud arquebuse and clashing
sword, the battle was practically won.</p>

2. beginning of the battle (noon, oct 7 1571)</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile there had been close and deadly fighting
in the centre. The main squadron of the Turks had,
like their right division, suffered from the fire of the advanced
galleasses. Several shots had struck the huge
galley that flew the flag of the Capitan-Pasha, Ali,
a white pennon sent from Mecca, embroidered in gold
with verses of the Koran. Ali steered straight for the
centre of the Christian line, where the group of large
galleys, the "Reale" with the embroidered standard
of the Holy League, Colonna's ship with its ensign of the
Papal Keys, and Veniero's with the Lion-flag of St. Mark,
told him he was striking at the heart of the confederacy.
He chose Don Juan's "Reale" for his adversary, relying
on the Seraskier Pertev Pasha, and the Pasha of Mitylene
on his left and right, to support him by attacking the other
two flagships.</p>

<p>Ali held the fire of his bow-guns till he was within a
short musket-shot of his enemy, and then fired at point-blank.
One of his cannon-balls crashed through the
bow barrier of the "Reale," and raked the rowers' benches,
killing several oarsmen. As the guns of the "Reale"
thundered out their reply, the bow of the Turkish flagship,
towering over the forecastle of Don Juan's vessel,
came through the smoke-cloud and struck the Spanish
ship stem to stem with a grinding crash and a splintering
of timber, throwing down many of the crew. The Turkish
bow dug deep into the Spanish ship, and in the confusion
of the collision it was thought for a moment she was
sinking, but a forward bulkhead kept her afloat. Ali's
ship rebounded from the shock, then glided alongside
the "Reale" with much mutual smashing of oars. The
two ships grappled, and the hand-to-hand fight began.
At the same time Pertev Pasha grappled Veniero's flagship,
and another Turkish galley, commanded by Ali's two sons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
forced its way through the line and engaged the two
galleys that lay astern of the flagship. Then the Pasha
of Mitylene closed upon Colonna's ship, and all along
the centre the galleys came dashing together. The crash
of broken oars, the rattling explosions of arquebuses
and grenades, the war-notes of the Christian trumpets
and the Turkish drums, the clash of swords, the shouts
and yells of the combatants, rose in a deafening din.
Froissart wrote in an earlier day that sea-fights were
always murderous. This last great battle of the medieval
navies had the character of its predecessors. In this
fight at close quarters on the narrow space afforded by
the galleys' decks there was no question of surrender on
either side, no thought but of which could strike the
hardest and kill the most. Nor could men, striving hand
to hand in the confusion of the floating m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, know
anything of what was being done beyond their limited
range of view, so that even the admirals became for the
moment only leaders of small groups of fighting-men.
On the poop and forecastle of the "Reale" were gathered
men whose names recalled all that was greatest in the
annals of Spanish chivalry, veterans who had fought the
Moor and voyaged the western ocean, and young cavaliers
eager to show themselves worthy sons of the lines of
Guzman and Mendoza, Benavides and Salazar. Don
Juan, arrayed in complete steel, stood by the flagstaff of
the consecrated standard. Along the bulwarks four hundred
Castilian arquebusiers in corselet and head-piece represented
the pick of the yet unconquered Spanish infantry.
The three hundred rowers had left the oars, and, armed
with pike and sword, were ready to second them, when
the musketry ceased and the storming of the Turkish
galleys began. From Ali's ship a hundred archers and three
hundred musketeers of the Janissary corps replied to the
fire of the Spaniards. The range was a few feet. Men
were firing in each other's faces, and at such close quarters
the arquebuse with its heavy ball was a more death-dealing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
weapon than the modern rifle. Such slaughter
could not last, and the <i>caballeros</i> were eager to end it by
closing on the Turks with cold steel.</p>

3. the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e (about 12.30 p.m.)</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Twice they dashed through the smoke over Ali's bulwarks,
and for a while gained a footing on the deck of
the enemy's flagship. Twice they were driven back by
the reinforcements that Ali drew from the crews of galleys
that had crowded to his aid. Then the Turks came clambering
over the bows of the "Reale," and nearly cleared
the forecastle. Don Bernardino de Cardenas brought
up a reserve from the waist of the ship and attacked
the Turkish boarders in the bows. He was struck by a
musket-ball. It dinted his steel helmet, but failed to
penetrate. Cardenas fell, stunned by the shock of the
blow, and died next day, "though he showed no sign of a
wound."</p>

<p>Don Juan himself was going forward sword in hand
to assist in the fight in the bows of the "Reale," and Ali
was hurrying up reinforcements to the attack. It was a
critical moment. But Colonna just then struck a decisive
blow. He had boarded and stormed the ship that attacked
him, a long galley commanded by the Bey of Negropont.
Having thus disposed of his immediate adversary, he
saw the peril of the "Reale." Manning all his oars, he
drove the bow of his flagship deep into the stern of Ali's
ship, swept her decks with a volley of musketry, and sent
a storming-party on to her poop. The diversion saved
the "Reale." The Spaniards hustled the Turks over
her bows at point of pike, and Ali, attacked on two sides,
had now to fight on the defensive.</p>

<p>On the other side of the "Reale" Veniero's flagship
was making a splendid fight. It is the details of those old
battles that bring home to us the changes of three centuries.
A modern admiral stands sheltered in his conning tower,
amid voice tubes and electrical transmitters. Veniero,
a veteran of seventy years, stood by the poop-rail of his
galley, thinking less of commanding than of doing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
own share of the killing. Balls and arrows whistled
around him, along the bulwarks amidships his men were
fighting hand to hand with the Seraskier's galley that
lay lashed alongside. There were no orders to give for
the moment, so he occupied himself with firing a blunderbuss
into the crowd on the Turkish deck, and handing it
to a servant to reload with half a dozen balls, and then
firing again and again.</p>

<p>Here, too, in the main squadron were fighting the galleys
of Spinola of Genoa, of the young Duke of Urbino, of
the Prince of Parma, of Bonelli, the nephew of Pius&nbsp;V,
of Sforza of Milan, and Gonzaga of Solferino, and the
young heirs of the Roman houses of Colonna and Orsini.
Venice had not all the glory of Lepanto. All Italy still
remembers that every noble family, every famous city,
from the Alps to Sicily, had its part in the battle.</p>

<p>Colonna's timely aid to the "Reale" was the turning-point
of the fight in the centre. Led by Vasquez Coronada and
Gil d'Andrada, the Spanish infantry poured into Ali's ship,
and winning their way foot by foot cleared her decks.
Not one of her four hundred fighting-men survived. Ali
himself was one of the last to fall. One account says
that when all was lost he cut his throat with his dagger,
another that he was shot down at close quarters. His
head was cut off, placed on a pike, and carried to Don
Juan with the captured standard of Mecca. The chivalrous
young admiral turned with disgust from the sight of
the blood-dripping head, and ordered it to be thrown
into the sea.</p>

<p>The battle had lasted an hour and a half. Don Juan
saw in the capture of the enemy's flagship the assurance
of victory. Like all great commanders, he knew the value
of moral effect. He hoisted the consecrated banner
of the League at the tall mast-head of the conquered
galley, and bade his trumpeters blow a flourish and his
men shout victory. In the confusion and uproar of the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e not many of the ships would see what was happening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
round the "Reale," but this demonstration would attract
the attention of friends and foes in the centre of the fight.
It was just one of the moments when, both parties becoming
exhausted by the prolonged struggle, success
would belong to the side that could put forth even for
a while the more vigorous effort, and the sight of the papal
standard fluttering from the Turkish mast, instead of
the banner of Mecca, inspired this effort on the part of
the Christians, and depressed and discouraged their
adversaries.</p>

<p>Pertev Pasha had lost heavily under the fire of the
Venetian flagship, and had failed in an effort to board
her. He cut his galley adrift. Veniero let her go, and
turned to attack other enemies. Pertev's ship drifted
down on two Christian galleys, and was promptly boarded
and taken. The Seraskier slipped on board of a small
craft he was towing astern, reached another ship, and,
giving up all hope of victory, fled with her from the fight.
Veniero had meanwhile rammed and sunk two other
galleys. He was wounded with a bullet in the leg, but
he had the wound bandaged and remained on deck. The
old man gave Venice good reason to be proud of her
admiral.</p>

<p>Along the left and centre of the Christian armada
there was now victory. Admirals and captains were
busy storming or sinking such of the enemy's ships as
still maintained the fight. On the left Barbarigo had been
mortally wounded, and the losses had been heavy, but
the success was so pronounced that large numbers of men
had been landed to hunt down the Turkish fugitives
on the shore. In the centre there was still some hard
fighting. Here it was that Miguel Cervantes, leading
the stormers to the capture of a Turkish galley, received
three wounds, one of which cost him his left hand.</p>

<p>When the battle began at noon, first on the allied left,
then in the centre, Doria, the Genoese admiral who
commanded the right, was not yet in position. His orders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
were to mark with his flagship the extreme right of the
line of battle so that the rest of his division could form on
this point. But it was soon seen that he was keeping away,
steering southward into the open sea, with his division
trailing after him in a long line, the galleasses that should
have been out in front coming slowly up behind the
squadron. Ulugh Ali with the left wing of the Turkish
fleet had also altered his course, and was steering on a
parallel line to that taken by the Genoese. Some of the
Christian captains who watched these movements from the
right centre thought that Doria was deserting the armada,
and even that he was in flight, pursued by Ulugh Ali.</p>

<p>Doria afterwards explained that, as he steered out from
behind the centre to take up his position in the battle
line, he saw that Ulugh Ali, instead of forming on Ali
Pasha's flank, was working out to seaward, and he therefore
believed that the Algerine was trying to get upon
the flank of the allied line, in order to envelop it and
attack from both front and rear, so as to crush the extreme
right with a local superiority of force. His plan was,
therefore, to confine himself to observing Ulugh Ali's
movements, steering on a parallel course in the hope
of eventually closing and meeting him fairly ship to ship.
Doria was an old sailor, perhaps the most experienced
leader in the fleet, except the veteran Veniero. If he
had been less of a tactician, perhaps he would have come
into action sooner. And it is strange that, while playing
for position against Ulugh Ali, he did not realize that if,
instead of continually increasing his own distance from
the centre, he had at any moment turned back towards
it, he could thus force the Algerine admiral either to close
with him or leave him free to overwhelm the Turkish
main squadron by enveloping its left.</p>

<p>It was Ulugh Ali, not Doria, who turned back and
ventured on a stroke like this. The Algerine had, after
all, outman&#0339;uvred the over-clever Genoese. The course
taken by the two squadrons had, with the drift of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
current, placed Ulugh Ali's rearmost ships actually somewhat
nearer the seaward flank of the main fighting lines
than Doria's galleys, which his squadron also outnumbered.
A signal ran down the long line of the Turkish left, and
while some of the galleys turned and bore down on Doria's
division, the rest swung round and, before Doria had
quite realized what was happening, Ulugh Ali, with the
heaviest ships of his division, was rushing towards the
fight in the centre.</p>

<p>The brunt of the Algerine's onset fell upon a dozen
galleys on Don Juan's right flank. The furthest out, the
flagship of the Knights of Malta, was attacked by seven
of the enemy's vessels. Next to her lay the papal galley
"Fiorenza," the Piedmontese "Margarita di Savoia,"
and seven or eight Venetian ships. All these were enveloped
in the Turkish attack which engaged the line
in front, flank and rear. There were no enemies the
Algerines hated so fiercely as the Knights of Malta, but,
even though they had the flagship of the Order at such a
fearful disadvantage, they did not venture to close with
it until they had overwhelmed the knights and their
crew with a murderous fire of bullets and arrows at close
quarters. Then they boarded the ship and disposed of
the few surviving defenders. The commander, Giustiniani,
wounded by five arrows, and a Sicilian and a Spanish
knight alone survived, and these only because they were
left for dead among the heaps of slain that encumbered
the deck. Ulugh Ali secured as a trophy of his success the
standard of the Knights. In the same way the "Fiorenza"
and the "San Giovanni" of the papal squadron, and
the Piedmontese ship, were rushed in rapid succession.
On the "Fiorenza" the only survivors were her captain,
Tomasso de Medici, and sixteen men, all wounded; the
captain of the "San Giovanni" was killed with most of
his men, and the captain of the Savoyard ship survived
an equally terrible slaughter, after receiving no less than
eleven wounds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>But Ulugh Ali was not to be allowed to "eat up"
the line ship by ship. Reinforcements were now arriving
in rapid succession. First Santa Cruz, with the reserve,
dashed into the fight, and though twice wounded with
shot from a Turkish arquebuse, drove his flagship into the
midst of the Algerines. Don Juan cut adrift a captured
ship he had just taken in tow, and with twelve galleys
hastened to assist the reserve in restoring the fight. Doria,
leaving part of his division to encounter the galleys Ulugh
Ali had detached against it, led the rest into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.
Colonna and Veniero were supporting Don Juan. The
local advantage of numbers, which Ulugh Ali at first
possessed, soon disappeared, but for more than an hour
the fight continued with heavy loss on both sides. Then
the Algerine admiral struggled out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and with
fourteen ships fled north-westward, steering for Cape
Oxia and the wide channel between Ithaca and the mainland.
Santa Cruz and Doria pursued for a while, but a
wind sprang up from the south-east, and the fugitives
set their long lateen sails. Under sail and oar a corsair
could generally defy pursuit.</p>

<p>The pursuers gave up the chase and returned to where
Don Juan and the other admirals were securing their
prizes, clearing the decks of dead, collecting the wounded,
and hurriedly repairing damages. It was now after
four o'clock, and less than three hours of daylight remained
for these operations. Besides the handful that
had escaped with Ulugh Ali, a few galleys had got away
into the Gulf of Corinth, making for Lepanto, but the
great Turkish armada had been destroyed, and the
victorious armament was mistress of the Mediterranean.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The success had been dearly bought. On both sides
the losses in the hard-fought battle had been terrible.
The allies had about 7500 men killed or drowned, two-thirds
of these fighting-men, the rest rowers. The nobles
and knights had exposed themselves freely in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e,
and Spain, Malta, Venice, and the Italian cities had each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and all their roll of heroic dead. The list of the Venetians
begins with the names of seventeen captains of ships,
including the admiral Barbarigo, besides twelve other
chiefs of great houses who fought under the standard
of St. Mark in command of companies of fighting-men.
No less than sixty of the Knights of St. John "gave their
lives that day for the cause of Christ," to quote the annalist
of the Order. Several others were wounded, and of these
the Prior Giustiniani and his captain, Naro, of Syracuse,
died soon after. One of the knights killed in the battle
was a Frenchman, Raymond de Loubi&egrave;re, a Proven&ccedil;al.
Another Frenchman, the veteran De Romegas, fought
beside Don Juan on the "Reale," and to his counsel
and aid the commander-in-chief attributed much of his
success in the campaign. The long lists of the Spanish,
Neapolitan, Roman, and Genoese nobles who fell at
Lepanto include many historic names.</p>

<p>The losses of the defeated Moslems were still heavier.
The lowest estimate makes the number of the dead 20,000,
the highest 30,000. Ali Pasha and most of his captains
were killed. Ali's two sons and several of his best officers
were among the prisoners. Fifteen Turkish galleys were
sunk or burned, no less than 190 ships were the prizes
of the victors. A few galleys had escaped by the Little
Dardanelles to Lepanto. A dozen more had found refuge
with Ulugh Ali in the fortified harbour of Santa Maura.
The Algerine eventually reached Constantinople, and
laid at the feet of Sultan Selim the standard of the Knights
of Malta, which he had secured when he was in temporary
possession of Giustiniani's flagship.</p>

<p>Don Juan's best trophies of victory were the 12,000
Christian slaves found on board the captured galleys.
They were men of all nations, and some of them had for
years toiled at the oar. Freed from their bondage, they
carried throughout all Christendom the news of the victory
and the fame of their deliverer.</p>

<p>Hardly three hours of daylight remained when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
battle ended, and the Christian admirals reluctantly
abandoned the pursuit of Ulugh Ali. The breeze that
had aided the Algerine in his flight was rapidly increasing
to a gale, and the sea was rising fast. The Christian fleet,
encumbered with nearly two hundred prizes, and crippled
by the loss of thousands of oars shattered in the fight,
was in serious danger in the exposed waters that had
been the scene of the battle. By strenuous and well-directed
efforts the crews of oarsmen were hurriedly
reorganized. Happily the wind was favourable for a
run through the Oxia Channel to the Bay of Petala.
The prizes were taken in tow. Sails were set. Weary
men tugged at the oar, knights and nobles taking their
places among them. As the October night deepened into
darkness, amid driving rain and roaring wind-squalls, the
fleet anchored in the sheltered bay.</p>

<p>The gale that swept the Adriatic was a warning that
the season for active operations was drawing to a close,
and the admirals reluctantly decided that no more could
be done till next spring. The swiftest ships were sent off
to carry the good news of Lepanto to Rome and Messina,
Venice and Genoa, Naples and Barcelona. The fleet
returned in triumph to Messina, and entered the port
trailing the captured Turkish standards in the water
astern of the ships that had taken them, while pealing
bells and saluting cannon greeted the victors.</p>

<p>Lepanto worthily closed the long history of the oar-driven
navies. The galleasses, with their tall masts and
great sails, and their bristling batteries of cannon, which
lay in front of Don Juan's battle line, represented the
new type of ship that was soon to alter the whole aspect
of naval war. So quickly came the change that men who
had fought at Lepanto were present, only seventeen
years later, at another world-famed battle that was fought
under sail, the defeat of King Philip's "Grand Armada"
in the Narrow Seas of the North.</p>

<p>Thus Macaulay begins his stirring ballad of the
Armada. The lines have helped to perpetuate
a popular error&mdash;one of the many connected with the
story as it is generally told in our English histories. It
somehow became the fashion at a very early date to speak
of the defeat of the so-called "Invincible Armada"
of Spain. But the Spaniards never gave their fleet such
a name. In the contemporary histories and in Spanish
official documents it is more modestly and truthfully
spoken of as the "Gran Armada"&mdash;"the great armed
force." And, by the way, our very use of the word
"armada" is based on popular ignorance of the Spanish
language, and on the impression produced in England
by the attempt of Philip&nbsp;II to make himself master of
the narrow seas, and invade our islands. An "armada"
is not necessarily a fleet. It is an armed force, an "army"
either marching on land or embarked for service on the
sea, in which case fleet and fighting-men are included in
the word.</p>

<p>Philip&nbsp;II was King not of Spain only, but also of Portugal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and of the Two Sicilies, ruler of other European lands and
"Lord of the Indies," the Sovereign of a widespread
maritime Empire in Asia, Africa, and America, that had
been won by a hundred years of enterprise on the part of
sailors and soldiers like Columbus and Vasco da Gama,
Cortes, Pizarro, and Albuquerque. The tradition of
Spanish victory on the sea was a proud one, and as we
have seen Spain had borne a leading part in the latest
of decisive naval victories, when the Turkish power
in the Mediterranean was shattered at Lepanto; King
Philip might therefore reasonably look forward to success
for his great fleet, and if it could once secure the mastery
of the Channel, the invasion of England might be regarded
as no very perilous enterprise. For the Spanish infantry
were the best soldiers of the day, and the Duke of Parma,
who was to command the land operations, was one of
the best and most experienced leaders in Europe.</p>

<p>Looking back on the events of the wonderful year of
the Armada, we must try to divest ourselves of the ideas
of to-day, and see things as the men of the time saw them.
Philip counted on divisions among the people of England.
The event proved that he was mistaken, but he had
reasonable grounds for the view he took. A hundred
years later another fleet conveyed a foreign army across
the narrow seas from the Netherlands to change effectively
the course of English affairs. It found a divided people,
and the invading army was welcomed by a party strong
enough to effect a Revolution that was a new starting-point
in English history. Nor must we suppose that
the policy of Philip&nbsp;II was directed entirely by religious
views. If kings were easily swayed by such motives,
there would have not been such difficulty about organizing
a League against the Turk.</p>

<p>Professor Laughton, in his introduction to the "State
Papers relating to the Defeat of the Armada," puts the
matter so clearly that it is worth while quoting his words
at some length:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is not strange that the action of the fleet was for
long misunderstood, and that the failure of the Spaniards
should have been represented&mdash;as it often is even now&mdash;as
due to a Heaven-sent storm. '<i>Flavit Deus et dissipati
sunt</i>' was accepted as at once a true and pious explanation
of the whole thing. It was, too, a flattering and economical
belief. We were, it has been argued, a nation peculiarly
dear to the Almighty, and He showed His favour by raising
a storm to overwhelm our enemy, when the odds against
us were most terrible. From the religious point of view such
a representation is childish; from the historical it is false.
False, because the Spanish fleet, after being hounded up
Channel, had sustained a crushing defeat from the English,
a defeat in which they lost many ships and thousands of
men before they fled to the north.... Childish, because in
affairs of State Providence works by recognized means,
and gives the victory, not by disturbing the course of
nature and nature's laws, but by giving the favoured
nation wise and prudent commanders, skilful and able
warriors; by teaching their hands to war and their fingers
to fight.</p>

<p>"But, in fact, much of the nonsense that has been talked
grew out of the attempt, not unsuccessfully made, to represent
the war as religious; to describe it as a species of
crusade instigated by the Pope, in order to bring heretical
England once more into the fold of the true Church. In
reality nothing can be more inaccurate. It is, indeed, quite
certain that religious bitterness was imported into the
quarrel; but the war had its origin in two perfectly clear
and wholly mundane causes."</p></div>

<p>Professor Laughton then goes on to explain what these
causes were: (1) the attempts of Drake and Hawkins to
break the Spanish monopoly of trade in the West Indies
by armed expeditions, which included the capture of
Spanish ships and the sacking of Spanish trading posts.
The Spaniards regarded Drake and Hawkins as smugglers
and pirates, and in vain asked Elizabeth to disavow
and make amends for their acts.</p>

<p>(2) "The countenance and assistance which had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
given by the English to the King's rebellious subjects in
the Low Countries."</p>

<p>The King was glad enough to put forward religious
reasons as the motives for his enterprise in the hope of
thus enlisting new allies on his side, but, like so many
other wars, the conflict between Spain and England, which
began in 1585, arose largely from rivalry in trade.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Santa Cruz, the same who had commanded
the allied reserve at Lepanto, was then the most
famous and the most trusted of King Philip's admirals.
Santa Cruz urged upon him the advisability of attempting
an invasion of England itself, as the only effective means of
cutting off the support given by Elizabeth to the revolt of
the Netherlands, and checking at their source the raids on
the West Indies. In March, 1586, he submitted to his
master an elaborate plan for the operation. Santa Cruz's
scheme was an ambitious project for concentrating the
whole force of the Spanish Empire in an attack on England.
Some 500 ships, great and small, were to be assembled in the
ports of the Spanish peninsula, and 85,000 men embarked
on them.</p>

<p>Philip&nbsp;II thought the scheme too vast, and, above all, too
costly. He substituted for it another plan, which was more
economical. Santa Cruz was to assemble in the Atlantic
ports of the Peninsula a fleet of more modest proportions,
just strong enough to secure command of the Channel.
This done, he was to cover the transportation across the
narrow seas of the Spanish army that was already operating
in the Netherlands, under the Duke of Parma. The army
of the Netherlands would be reinforced with all the fighting-men
that could be spared from the fleet. This was in its
essential points the plan of campaign of the "Gran'
Armada" of 1588.</p>

<p>It was intended that the attempt should be made in the
summer of 1587. It was delayed for a twelvemonth by a
daring enterprise of Francis Drake, a memorable enterprise,
because in proposing it he laid down the true principle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
for the defence of England against invasion. His policy
was that of Edward&nbsp;III at Sluys, his principle that it was
better to keep the enemy occupied on his own coasts rather
than await him on those of England. On 2 April, 1587,
Drake sailed for Spain with only thirty ships, and surprised
and burned the half-armed transports and storeships
collected at Cadiz for fitting out the Armada. His dashing
enterprise had made its departure for that year impossible.</p>

<p>Before the preparations for the next summer's campaign
were completed the Marquis of Santa Cruz died, and Spain
lost her best and most experienced admiral. King Philip
put in his place a great noble, Guzman, Duke of Medina-Sidonia,
who pleaded in vain to be excused, frankly
declaring to his sovereign that he felt unfit for such high
command, as he had scant knowledge of war and no
experience of the sea. It is supposed that the King persisted
in the nomination because Medina-Sidonia's hereditary
rank would place him above the jealousies of the
subordinate commanders, and he hoped to supply for the
Marquis's inexperience by sending veteran sailors and
soldiers with him as his staff-officers and divisional commanders.</p>

<p>By the middle of May, 1588, the Armada was at last
ready to sail from the Tagus. In England there had been
the wildest reports as to its numbers and strength. These
exaggerations were repeated by the popular historians of
the fighting in the Channel, and have become almost a
national tradition. The Spanish galleons were said to be
floating monsters, more like castles than ships; the fleet
was so numerous that it hid the sea, and looked like a
moving town; it "seemed as if room would scarce be found
on the ocean for so vast an armament."</p>

<p>The glory of the English victory was great enough to
need no exaggeration to enhance it. But in sober fact
there was no such enormous disparity, as is generally
imagined, between the opposing forces.</p>

<p>Large and small, there were 130 ships in the Armada.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The detailed catalogue of them, from the list sent by
Medina-Sidonia to Philip&nbsp;II, has been reprinted by Captain
Duro in his "Armada Invencibile," and by Professor
Laughton in his "State Papers relating to the Armada."
From these sources I take a summarized table giving the
statistics of the Armada, and then add some particulars as
to various squadrons, ships, and commanders:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first point to note about the Armada is that it was
almost entirely a fleet of sailing-ships. The new period of
naval war had begun. There had been hundreds of galleys
at Lepanto, seventeen years earlier, but there were only
four in the Armada, and none of these reached the Channel.
The long, low, oar-driven warship, that for two thousand
years had done so much fighting in the Mediterranean,
proved useless in the long waves of the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
only oared ships that really took part in the campaign
were the four galleasses, and in these the oar was only
auxiliary to the spread of sail on their three full-rigged
masts. The galleasse has been described in the story
of Lepanto. It was an intermediate or transition type
of ship. It seems to have so impressed the English
onlookers that the four galleasses are given quite an unmerited
importance in some of the popular narratives of
the war.</p>

<p>But the day of sails had come, and the really effective
strength of the Armada lay in the tall galleons of the six
"armadas" or squadrons of Portugal, the Spanish provinces,
and the Levantine traders. The galleon was a
large sailing-ship, but even as to the size of the galleons the
popular tradition of history is full of exaggeration. Built
primarily for commerce, not for war, they carried fewer
guns than the galleasses, though many of them were of
heavier tonnage. In those days every large trader carried
a certain number of guns for her protection, but such guns
were mostly of small calibre and short range.</p>

<p class="caption center">
<span class="smcap">the "great armada" entering the channel</span><br />
<i>From the drawing by W. H. Overena</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>The largest galleons were in the armada of the Levant.
The flagship, "La Regazona," commanded by Martin de
Bertendona, was the biggest ship in the whole fleet, a
great vessel of 1249 tons. But she only mounted 30 guns,
mostly light pieces. Compare this with the armament of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the galleasses, and one sees the difference between ships
built for war and galleons that were primarily traders. The
largest of the four galleasses was only of 264 tons, the
smallest 169, but each of the four mounted 50 guns. In all
the six armadas of galleons there were only seven ships of
over a thousand tons. There were fourteen more of over
800, and a considerable number of under 500 tons. But
the galleon looked larger than she really was. Such ships
had high bulwarks and towering fore and stern castles,
and they appear to have been over-rigged with huge
masts and heavy yards. A galleon under full sail must
have been a splendid sight, the bows and stern and the tall
"castles" tricked out with carving, gold and colour.
Great lanterns were fixed on the poop. The sails were not
dull stretches of canvas, but bright with colour, for woven
into or embroidered on them there were huge coats-of-arms,
or brilliantly coloured crosses, and even pictures of the
saints with gilded haloes. From the mastheads fluttered
pennons thirty or forty feet long, and flagstaffs displayed
not only the broad standard of the Lions and Castles of
Spain, but also the banners of nobles and knights who
were serving on board.</p>

<p>But the tall ship, with her proud display of gold and
colour, was more splendid than formidable, and the Elizabethan
seamen had soon realized the fact. Built originally
for the more equable weather of the trade-wind region in
the South Atlantic, she was not so well fitted for the wilder
seas and changing winds of the North. She was essentially
an unhandy ship. In bad weather she rolled heavily, and
her heavy masts and spars and high upper works strained
the whole structure, so that she was soon leaking badly.
With the wind abeam and blowing hard, her tall sides and
towering castles were like sails that could not be reefed,
a resisting surface that complicated all man&#0339;uvres. The
guns that looked out from her port-holes were mostly small
cannon, many of them mere three and four-pounders, of
short range and little effect. So small was the dependence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the Spaniards placed upon them that they carried only the
scantiest supply of ammunition.</p>

<p>The fighting method of the galleon was to bear close
down upon her opponent, run her aboard, if possible, pour
down a heavy fire of musketry from the high bulwarks and
castles, so as to bring a plunging shower of bullets on the
enemy's decks, and then board, and let pike and sword do
their work as they had done at Lepanto. These were, after
all, the methods of the soldier, the tactics of the war-galley.
It was the merit of Howard, Hawkins, Drake, and the
other great captains, who commanded against the Armada,
that they fought as seamen, using their more handy and
better handled ships to choose their own position and range,
refusing to let the Spaniards close, and bringing a more
powerful, longer-ranging, and better served artillery to bear
with destructive effect on the easy targets supplied by the
tall galleons. It is worth noting that while there were more
soldiers than seamen in the Armada, there were more seamen
than soldiers in the fleet that met it in the narrow seas.</p>

<p>If the Armada had a commander whose only merit was
personal courage, the admirals of the various squadrons
were all men of long experience in war, both by land and
sea. Martinez de Recalde, the second in command and
admiral of the armada of Biscay, was a veteran seaman.
Diego Flores de Valdes, the admiral of Castille, was an
enterprising and skilful leader, and if his advice had been
taken at the outset there might have been a disaster for
England. Pedro de Valdes, the admiral of Andalusia, had
sailed the northern seas, and Medina-Sidonia was told he
might rely on his local knowledge. Moncada, the admiral
of the galleasses, was a "first-rate fighting-man," and De
Leyva, the general of the troops embarked, who had taken
command of the "Rata Coronada," a great galleon of 800
tons in the Levant armada, showed that he was sailor as
well as soldier.</p>

<p>The Duke of Parma, who commanded the army that was
to be embarked from the Netherlands, was counted the best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
general of the day, and his 30,000 Spanish regular infantry
were the most formidable body of troops then in Europe.
His orders from the King were to build or collect a flotilla of
flat-bottomed barges to ferry his army across the straits
under the protection of the Armada, and for months
thousands of shipwrights had been at work in fishing ports
and creeks, canals and rivers along the coast between
Calais and Ostend. The Dutch rebels held Flushing and
the mouth of the Scheldt, and they had a small but efficient
fleet ready to do good service as the ally of England&mdash;a fact
often overlooked in our popular stories of the Armada.
Parma had proposed that he should attempt to reduce
Flushing and obtain command of the Scheldt, as a preliminary
to the enterprise against England. The Armada
could then run for the Scheldt, and make Antwerp its base
of operations. But Philip was impatient of further delays.
Though the best of the Spanish admirals were against him,
the King insisted that the Armada need only run up
Channel and obtain temporary command of the straits to
enable Parma to embark his army in the flotilla even from
an open beach. In the King's mind the necessity of destroying
the hostile sea power as a prelude to any scheme of invasion
was disregarded or was not understood.</p>

<p>On 30 May, in fine weather, the Armada at last sailed
from Lisbon. The reports sent back to Philip&nbsp;II by Medina-Sidonia,
as the fleet passed Cape Finisterre and stood out
into the Bay of Biscay, told that all was well. But a few
days later a storm from the Atlantic swept the sea, and
partly dispersed the Armada. The storeships held on till
they sighted the Scilly Islands, and then, finding they had
parted from the fleet, turned back. Into the northern
ports of Spain came scattered ships that had lost spars and
sails, some of them leaking so badly that only hard labour
at the pumps kept them afloat. Medina-Sidonia, with the
main body, made for Corunna, where he ordered the
stragglers to reassemble. On 19 June he wrote to the King
reporting his arrival.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>Then he sent letters betraying so much discouragement
and irresolution that one wonders he was not promptly relieved
of his command. He proposed that the whole enterprise
should be abandoned and some means found for
arranging terms of peace. He reported that the fleet had
suffered badly in the storm; that there was much sickness
on board; that large quantities of provisions had gone
bad, and must be replaced; and that the ships were short
of water. Instead of dismissing him from the command,
the King wrote to his admiral ordering and encouraging
him to renew the attempt. The ships were refitted and
provisioned, and drafts of men collected to replace the invalided
soldiers and sailors. Early in July the Armada
was again ready for sea.</p>

<p>The news that King Philip's Great Armada had been
beaten back by the wild Biscay gales reached England when
the whole country was in a fever of preparation for resistance.
A commission of noblemen and gentlemen had
been appointed "to sett doune such meanes as are fittest
to putt the forces of the Realme in order to withstand any
invasion." The Lord-Lieutenants of the counties were
directed to be ready to call out the local levies, which
formed a roughly armed, and mostly untrained, militia.
Garrisons were organized in the seaports, formed of more
reliable and better equipped men, and a small force was
collected at Tilbury to oppose a landing in the Thames
estuary. Faggots and brushwood were piled on hill-tops
from Land's End to Berwick to send the news of the
Spaniards' arrival through England by a chain of beacon
fires.</p>

<p>The best of the Queen's advisers, men like the Lord
Admiral Howard of Effingham, and such experienced seamen
as Hawkins, Drake, and Fenner, realized, and succeeded
in persuading the Council, that it was on the sea,
and not on the land, that England must be protected from
invasion. Their letters in the Armada State Papers are
full of practical lessons even for the present time. While
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
insisting that the main effort must be concentrated on the
fleet, they did not disregard the advisability of subsidiary
preparations on land, in case of accidents. But Howard
insisted that a few well-trained men were worth fourfold
their number of irregular levies, and wrote to the Council:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I pray your Lordships to pardon me that I may put you
in remembrance to move her Majesty that she may have an
especial care to draw ten or twelve thousand men about her
own person, that may not be men unpractised. For this
she may well assure herself that 10,000 men, that be
practised and trained together under a good governor and
expert leaders, shall do her Majesty more service than any
40,000 which shall come from any other parts of the realm.
For, my Lords, we have here 6000 men in the fleet, which
we shall be able, out of our company, to land upon any great
occasion, which being as they have been trained here under
captains and men of experience, and each man knowing his
charge and they their captains, I had rather have them to do
any exploit than any 16,000 men out of any part of the
realm."</p></div>

<p>The fleet, from which Howard of Effingham was ready
to land these trained men if necessary, was even more
numerous than the Armada itself, though the average size
of the ships was smaller. On the list there appear the
names of no fewer than 197 ships, ranging in size from the
"Triumph" of 1100 tons (Frobisher's ship) down to small
coasting craft. The flagship, the "Ark," or "Ark Royal,"
was a vessel of 800 tons. Contemporary prints show that
she had a high poop and forecastle, but not on the exaggerated
scale of the Spanish galleons; and that she had
four masts, and was pierced with three tiers of port-holes
for guns, besides gun-ports in the stern. She had a crew
of 270 mariners, 34 gunners, and 126 soldiers. Contrary to
the system on which the Armada was manned, the seamen
in every ship of the English fleet exceeded the soldiers in
number. "The Ark" carried no less than 44 guns, namely,
4 "cannon" (60-pounders), 4 "demi-cannon" (30-pounders)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
12 "culverins" (long 18-pounders), 12 "demi-culverins"
(long 9-pounders), 6 "sakers" (6-pounders), and six smaller
pieces, some of them mounted inboard for resisting boarders
at close quarters.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This was an armament equalled by few
of the Spanish ships, and the fact is that the English ships
as a rule were better armed than the Spaniards.</p>

<p>But few of Howard's fleet were of heavy tonnage. There
were only two ships of over 1000 tons; one of 900; two
of 800; three of 600; five or six of 500, and all the rest less
than 400 tons, many of them less than 100. But though the
English ships were smaller than the Spaniards, they were
better at sailing and man&#0339;uvring, thoroughly handy craft,
manned by sailors who knew how to make them do their
best, and who were quite at home in the rough northern
seas.</p>

<p>The main body of the fleet under Howard of Effingham
assembled at Plymouth. Detached squadrons under Lord
Henry Seymour and Sir W. Winter watched the Straits of
Dover. Some of the captains thought Plymouth had been
unwisely chosen as the station of the main fleet, pointing out
that a south or south-west wind, which would be a fair wind
for the Spaniards, would be a very foul one for ships working
out of the long inlet of Plymouth Harbour.</p>

<p>In June, Howard had news that the Armada was not only
at sea, but far on its voyage. Merchantmen ran for shelter
to Plymouth, and told how they had met at least two
squadrons of large ships with great red crosses on their foresails
off Land's End, and in the entrance of the Channel.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
One ship had been chased and fired on by a Spaniard.
Then all trace of the enemy was lost. There was no news of
him in the Channel or on the Irish coasts. The weather had
been bad, and it was rightly conjectured that the squadrons
sighted off Land's End were only detachments of the
Armada scattered by the storm, and that the great fleet
had put back to Spain, probably to Corunna. This was
soon confirmed by reports from France.</p>

<p>For a while there was an impression that the danger was
over. Drake, Hawkins, and other captains urged that now
was the time to take the English fleet to the Spanish coast
and destroy the crippled and discouraged Armada in its
harbours. But the Queen and her Council hesitated to
adopt so bold a policy, and only a few ships were sent out
to watch for the enemy in the Bay of Biscay. These returned
driven before a strong south wind, and then fugitives
from the Channel brought news that there was a crowd of
ships off the Lizard, and Howard in a short note reported
that he had gone out to engage them. The Armada had
come in earnest at last.</p>

<p>After refitting at Corunna, Medina-Sidonia had sailed on
22 July with fine weather and a fair south wind. Progress
was not rapid, for the great fleet's speed was that of its
slowest ships. On the 26th, when the Armada was well out
to sea off the headlands of Brittany, the morning was dull
and cloudy, and towards noon the wind went round to the
northward and increased to half a gale, raising a heavy sea.
The course was changed to the eastward, and the ships were
kept under shortened sail. The four galleys, unable to face
the rising storm, ran for shelter towards the French coast,
and never rejoined. They went southwards before the
wind. One was wrecked near Bayonne. The three others
reached Spain.</p>

<p>All next day the gale blew heavily. The Armada,
scattered over a wide extent of sea, beat slowly to windward,
working away from the dangerous French coast.
Many ships temporarily parted company. It looked as if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
there would be another failure. But on Thursday the 28th
(to quote the Spanish admiral's diary) "the day dawned
clear and bright, the wind and sea more quiet than the day
before. Forty ships were counted to be missing." The
admiral sent out three pinnaces to look for them, and next
day, Friday, 29 July (19 July, O.S.), had news that all
but one of them were with Pedro de Valdes off the
Lizard. This was the crowd of ships reported that same
day to Howard at Plymouth.</p>

<p>The missing ship, the "Santa Ana," the flagship of
Biscay, rejoined later. In the evening Medina-Sidonia saw
the coast of England, and notes that it was "said to be the
Lizard." On the Saturday the admiral writes that "at
dawn the Armada was near with the land, so as we were
seen therefrom, whereupon they made fire and smokes."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The crew of a captured fishing-boat later in the day told
him they had seen the English fleet coming out of Plymouth,
and in the evening Medina-Sidonia's diary tells that
"many ships were seen, but because of the mist and rain
we were unable to count them."</p>

<p>A council of war had been held on board his flagship, the
"San Martin." The wind was south-west, the very wind
to carry the Armada into Plymouth, and dead against the
English fleet coming out. De Leyva proposed that the
opportunity should be taken to attack the English in
Plymouth Sound. Once in the narrow waters the Spaniards
could run them aboard and have the advantage of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
superior numbers of fighting-men in a hand-to-hand conflict
on the decks. The soldier's advice was good, but the
sailors were against him. They argued that the fleet must
enter Plymouth Sound in line ahead at the risk of being
destroyed in detail, as the shoals at the entrance (those on
which the breakwater of to-day stands) left only two
narrow channels. De Leyva's bold plan was rejected, and
it was decided that the Armada should proceed up Channel.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Next day the fighting began. The wind had shifted to
the north-west, a good enough wind for working up Channel
on the port tack. English contemporary accounts say the
Armada was formed in a half-moon, a centre and two wings
slightly thrown forward. Howard had as yet only brought
part of his fleet out of Plymouth, but though greatly outnumbered
by the Spaniards, he had his best ships and his
most enterprising captains with him, and nothing daunted
by the grand array of the Armada, he began a series of
harassing attacks upon it.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, 31 July, according to the Spanish
reckoning, the 21st according to the Old Style still used in
England. It was a sunny day, with just enough wind to
help the nimble, seaworthy English ships in their guerilla
tactics. Howard's policy was to take full advantage of the
three factors that were on his side in the solution of the
problem, better seamanship in his crews, better gunnery,
and handier ships. To close with and grapple in the fashion
of earlier naval battles would have been to risk being
crushed by superior numbers. His policy was to hang upon
the flank or rear of the Armada, close in and try to cripple
one or more ships by artillery fire, slip away if the enemy
turned upon him, come on again as they gave up the
attempt to close, and he was ready all the time to swoop
down upon and capture any ship that might be detached
from her consorts. At the time arm-chair critics on shore
found fault with what they considered the half-hearted
conduct of the admiral, and the Queen's Council inquired
why it was that none of the Spanish ships had been boarded.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Sir Walter Raleigh, who, as Professor Laughton notes,
"must have often talked with Howard, and Drake, and
Hawkins, while the business was fresh in their memories,"
thus explains and defends the admiral's conduct:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Certainly, he that will happily perform a fight at sea
must believe that there is more belonging to a good man of
war upon the waters than great daring, and must know that
there is a great deal of difference between fighting loose or
at large and grappling. To clap ships together without
consideration belongs rather to a madman than to a man of
war; for by such an ignorant bravery was Peter Strozzi
lost at the Azores, when he fought against the Marquis of
Santa Cruz. In like sort had the Lord Charles Howard,
Admiral of England, been lost in the year 1588, if he had
not been better advised than a great many malignant fools
were, that found fault with his demeanour. The Spaniards
had an army aboard them, and he had none; they had
more ships than he had, and of higher building and charging;
so that, had he entangled himself with those great and
powerful vessels, he had greatly endangered this kingdom
of England. For twenty men upon the defences are equal
to a hundred that board and enter; whereas then, contrariwise,
the Spaniards had a hundred for twenty of ours, to
defend themselves withal. But our admiral knew his advantage
and held it; which had he not done, he had not
been worthy to have held his head."</p></div>

<p>The shift of the wind to the north-west had given the
English the weather gage. They could run down before
it on the enemy, and beat back against it in a way that was
impossible for the clumsy galleons. Thus Howard and his
captains could choose their own position and range during
the fighting. It began by a pinnace, appropriately named
the "Defiance," firing a shot at the nearest Spaniards, a
challenge to battle. Medina-Sidonia held his course and
took no notice of it. Howard's squadron now swept past
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
his left, and then engaged his rear ships. The admiral himself
in "The Ark" steered for De Leyva's tall galleon, the
"Rata Coronada," perhaps taking her to be the flagship of
the whole Armada. The two ships were soon in action, the
English gunners firing at the Spaniard's great hull, and De
Leyva's men aiming at the masts and yards of the "Ark"
in the hope of bringing down her spars and sails, crippling
and then boarding her. The better gunnery was on the
English side. They fired three shots to the Spaniards' one,
and every shot told on the huge target. And shots in the
hull meant much loss of life and limb in the crowded decks.</p>

<p>As Recalde with the rear division shortened sail, and
turned to the help of De Leyva, the "Ark" and her
consorts bore away, only to return again to the attack,
bringing their guns into action against Recalde's huge
galleon, the "Santa Ana," and Pedro Valdes's ship, the
"Rosario," "Capitana," or flagship of the Biscayan
armada. These two had become separated from the main
body with a few of her ships that now formed a kind of
rearguard. Frobisher in the "Triumph" and Hawkins in
the "Victory" were prominent in the attack. On the
Spanish side several of the flagships joined in this rearguard
fight. The admirals showed a chivalrous disposition to
come to close quarters, and thus Howard was engaged with
some of the largest and best commanded ships of the
enemy. Oquendo, the admiral of Guipuzcoa, in his 1200-ton
galleon, called, like that of Recalde, the "Santa Ana,"
had soon to draw out of the fight, with his ship on fire and
badly damaged, not by the English cannon, but by a powder
explosion on his main gundeck.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> One only wonders that
such accidents were not frequent on both sides, for the
powder was ladled into the guns from open gunpowder kegs,
and matches were kept burning beside each gun.</p>

<p>The "fighting loose and at large" went on for about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
three hours. Recalde's ship was badly hulled, and also had
her rigging cut up and one of her masts damaged. Pedro
Valdes's flagship, the "Rosario," was twice in collision with
a consort, with disastrous results. Her bowsprit was
carried away, and her foremast went over the side, the
strain on the rigging bringing down the main topmast with
it. When the English drew off just before sundown, Valdes
was busy cutting away the wreckage. Medina-Sidonia
shortened sail to enable the rearward ships to rejoin, and
then held his course up Channel. Valdes sent a request to
him that a ship should be detailed to tow the disabled
"Rosario," which otherwise could not keep up with the
fleet. It is generally stated that Medina-Sidonia took no
notice of the message, and abandoned Valdes to his fate,
but in his narrative the Duke reports to King Philip that
he personally endeavoured to assist the disabled "Rosario,"
and succeeded in removing the wounded from her,
only failing to save her "owing to the heavy sea and the
darkness of the weather."</p>

<p>The English do not seem to have been troubled by the
weather, and it cannot have been very bad, or the wounded
could not have been taken by boats from Oquendo's ship.
Evidently no great effort was made to succour the "Rosario,"
and the ships detailed for the work did not like to lie
in isolation so near the English during the night. The impression
in the Armada certainly was that the gallant
Valdes had been shamefully abandoned by the admiral.</p>

<p>Before sunset a council of war had been held by Howard
on board the "Ark." It was decided to follow up the
Armada through the short summer night. To Drake in the
"Revenge" was assigned the task of keeping touch with
them and guiding the pursuit by displaying a large stern
lantern on his ship.</p>

<p>After dark Howard lost sight of the lantern, and then
thought he had picked it up again, but at daylight he found
that he must have steered by a light in the Armada, for as
the day broke he lay with only a few ships perilously near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the main body of the enemy. Drake explained that in the
darkness he had thought that some ships of the enemy were
turning back, and had followed them. He had certainly
failed in his important duty, and there was a suspicion
that the veteran buccaneer was really man&#0339;uvring to make
sure of a prize, for at sunrise his ship, the "Revenge," lay
near the crippled "Rosario," which had been deserted by
her consorts. He summoned Valdes to surrender, and the
Spaniard, with his ship helpless and menaced by the main
English fleet, hauled down his flag. The huge galleon was
towed into Weymouth, the first prize of the campaign.</p>

<p>Howard had drawn off from the enemy, helped to secure
the "Rosario," and rallied his own fleet, which had
straggled during the night. This day, Monday, 1 August
(or 22 July, Old Style), there was no fighting, the Armada
working slowly up Channel, followed by the English out of
cannon-range. Medina-Sidonia formed a rearguard of forty
galleons and three galleasses, "in all 43 of the best ships
of the Armada to confront the enemy, so that there should
be no hindrance to our joining with the Duke of Parma;
and the Duke with the rest of the Armada should go in
the van, so that the whole fleet was divided into only two
squadrons, Don Alonso de Leyva taking the rear under his
charge." At 11 a.m. Oquendo's ship was reported to be
sinking. Her crew and "the King's money" were taken
out of her, and the "Santa Ana," largest but one of King
Philip's galleons, disappeared under the grey-green waves
of the Channel. In two days the Armada had lost two of
its divisional flagships.</p>

<p>Howard had been reinforced during the day from the
Western Channel ports. After the free expenditure of
powder and shot the previous day, his magazines were half
empty, and he husbanded his ammunition and followed up
the Spaniards out of fighting range, writing to Portsmouth
to have all ships there ready to join him. "We mean so to
course the enemy," he added, "that they shall have no
leisure to land."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>Seymour reported to the Council from Dover that the
Armada was well up Channel, and he feared they might
seize the Isle of Wight. He asked for "powder and shot"
for his squadron&mdash;"whereof we have want in our fleet, and
which I have divers times given knowledge thereof." All
the English commanders felt this want of ammunition and
supplies. The Queen's parsimony was endangering the
country.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday morning, 2 August (23 July, Old Style),
the Armada was off Portland. In the night the wind had
gone round to the north-east, and as the sun rose Howard's
fleet was seen to be between the Spaniards and the land and
to leeward of them. Medina-Sidonia was no sailor, but his
veteran commanders saw the chance the shift of the wind
had given them. The Armada turned from its course up
Channel, and on the starboard tack stood towards the
English fleet, hoping in Spanish phrase to catch the enemy
"between the sword and the wall."</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment for Howard and his captains
when the Armada came sweeping down on them, the
galleasses in front pushing ahead with sail and oar, behind
the long lines of galleons with the wind in the painted sails
of their towering masts. It looked as if the Spaniards would
soon be locked in close fight with the English squadron, with
every advantage on the side of King Philip's floating
castles. Led by the "Ark," the English ships began to
beat out to seaward with scant room for the man&#0339;uvre.
But just as the close fight seemed inevitable and the tall
"<span class="ins" title="Reganzona">Regazona</span>" had almost run the "Ark" aboard, and
while both ships were wrapped in a fog of powder smoke,
the wind suddenly shifted again, backing to the northward.
Howard was now working out well from the land, and
every moment improved the position.</p>

<p>There was a heavy cannonade on both sides, but as the
range lengthened, the advantage was with the better
gunners of the English ships. The galleasses, led by the
great "Florencia," tried, with the help of their long oars,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to fall on the English rear, the galleons tacked and made
one more attempt "to come to hand-stroke," but, writes
Sidonia, "all to little effect, the enemy avoiding our attack
by the lightness of their vessels." Good seamanship told.
Howard's ships were soon in a position to resume the
"fighting loose" tactics of the first battle, and the
Spaniards knew that at this game they were the losers. So
the Armada bore away, resuming its course up Channel,
and the cannonade died down into dropping long shots, and
then ceased, for Howard had no ammunition to spare.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday the two fleets crept slowly up Channel,
the English some six miles astern of the Armada. Once
they closed up, and a few shots were exchanged with the
galleasses in Recalde's rearguard. But Howard did not
want to fight. He was only "putting on a brag countenance,"
for he was woefully short of ammunition, and writing
urgently for much-needed supplies. The wind had fallen,
and in the afternoon some of the galleons were drifting
along, heeled over by shifting guns and stores to enable
the carpenters slung over the sides to plug shot-holes near
the waterline.</p>

<p>On Thursday the fleets were off the Isle of Wight, and it
was almost a calm, with occasional flaws of wind to help
them on their way. Welcome reinforcements from Portsmouth
joined Howard, and he received some ammunition.
Soon after sunrise there was a sharp fight. The "Santa
Ana" and a Portuguese galleon had fallen astern of the
Armada, and Hawkins, in the "Victory," supported by
several other ships, attacked them. He had done considerable
damage to the "Santa Ana," and already
reckoned her a prize, when the ever-ready De Leyva, with
the great "Rata" and the galleasses, came to the rescue,
and Hawkins reluctantly drew off. Howard, with the
"Ark," and his nephew, Lord Thomas Howard, in the
"Golden Lion," had come up to cover the retirement of
Hawkins. They became involved in a fight with the
Spanish rearguard, and the "Ark" was damaged, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to one account, by a collision, but it seems more likely that
her steering gear was temporarily put out of order by a
chance shot. She fell behind her consorts, and lowered
boats to tow her out of action. For the moment the wind
was helping the Spaniards, and, led by Medina-Sidonia
himself, several galleons turned to attack the "Ark." But
the wind freshened and changed suddenly, and the English
ships escaped from their dangerous position, and so the
fight ended.</p>

<p>On the Friday it was almost a dead calm. It was a
bright summer day, and from the hills of the Isle of Wight
there was a wondrous spectacle of the two fleets drifting
idly over miles of sea, with the sails flapping against the
masts. On board the "Ark," now repaired and again fit
for action, there was a stately ceremony, the admiral, in the
Queen's name, conferring knighthood on Hawkins, Frobisher
and several other of the captains who had taken a
leading part in the fighting. It was decided not to engage
the enemy again till the fleets had reached the Straits of
Dover. Shortness of ammunition was the reason for this
decision.</p>

<p>Medina-Sidonia was anxious on the same score. He sent
off a pilot-boat to the Duke of Parma, asking him to send
him a supply of "four, six, and ten-pound shot," "because
much of his ammunition had been wasted in the several
fights." The mention of such small weights shows with
what light artillery most of the galleons were armed. He
also asked Parma to send forty light craft to join the
Armada, "to the end he might be able with them to close
with the enemy, because our ships being very heavy in
comparison with the lightness of those of the enemy, it was
impossible to come to hand-stroke with them."</p>

<p>At sunset the wind freshened, and at daybreak on
Saturday the English were seen following up closely, but
there was no fighting, "the Armada sailing with a fair
wind and the rear close up, and in very good order." At
10 a.m. the French coast near Boulogne was in sight.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
At four in the afternoon the Armada was off Calais, and
at five orders were given to anchor in Calais roads, "seven
leagues from Dunkirk," or between Calais and Gravelines.
The Spaniards noticed that some thirty-six ships had
joined Howard's fleet, which anchored about a league
away. The new arrivals were Seymour's and Winter's
squadrons from Dover and the Downs.</p>

<p>Medina-Sidonia now believed that he had all but accomplished
his task. English writers say that the enemy were
disappointed and discouraged when they anchored off
Calais, but there is no proof of this in contemporary
Spanish accounts. Medina-Sidonia thought it a success
that he had got into touch with the Viceroy of the Netherlands.
He had sent off a messenger to his head-quarters at
Dunkirk, asking him to embark his army at once, and
declaring his readiness to convoy it across Channel.</p>

<p>But Medina-Sidonia was in a fool's paradise. His
ignorance of war was the ultimate source of his satisfaction
with the outlook. Better men, like Leyva and Recalde,
realized that until the enemy's fleet was not merely eluded,
but effectively beaten, there could be no invasion of England.
The French Governor of Calais told the admiral that
a change in the weather might make his position very unpleasant,
and Medina-Sidonia urged Parma to act at once
by telling him "that he could not tarry without endangering
the whole fleet."</p>

<p>But Parma was neither ready nor anxious for any prompt
action. The fleet of the Netherlanders, some fifty sail, was
blockading most of the places along the coast where he had
prepared his flat-bottomed boats. He knew better than to
embark the force he had in hand at Dunkirk till Howard's
fleet was disposed of.</p>

<p>But Howard was determined not to leave the Armada
undisturbed in its exposed anchorage. He had no sooner
been joined by Seymour and Winter than he hurriedly prepared
eight small craft in his own fleet to be used as fireships,
by turning over to them all the inflammable lumber
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
he could collect from the other vessels, and removing their
guns, ammunition, and stores.</p>

<p>Medina-Sidonia had spent the Sunday writing pressing
letters to the Prince of Parma, and obtaining fresh water
and other supplies from Calais. When the long summer
twilight ended the Armada was still riding at anchor, the
irregular lines of dark hulls stretching for miles, with
lanterns flickering at yard-arm or poop, and guard-boats
rowing about the outskirts of the floating city. At midnight
there was a cry of alarm passed from ship to ship.
The tide was running strong from the westward through
the Straits, and sweeping along on its current came eight
dark masses, each defined in the night by a red flicker of
fire that rose higher and spread wider as the English fireships
came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Three years before, when Parma was besieging Antwerp,
the revolted Netherlanders had attacked the bridge he had
thrown across the river below the city by sending drifting
down upon it a ship laden with powder barrels, with a
burning fuse and powder-train to fire them, and blocks of
stone heaped over them to increase the force of the explosion.
The awful destruction caused by this floating
volcano made the Spaniards long after fearful of the
attempt being repeated elsewhere, and Medina-Sidonia
tells in his diary that when Howard's fireships came
drifting through the summer night off Gravelines, he and
his captains thought that they were likely to be <i>maquinas
de minas</i>, "contrivances of mines," like the terrible floating
mine of Antwerp. With this suspicion, all idea of grappling
them was abandoned. As they drew nearer there was
something like a panic in the Armada. The admiral
signalled to weigh anchor and make sail, but few of the
ships waited for the tedious operation of getting the heavy
anchors up to the cat-heads by slow hand labour on windlass
or capstan. In most of the galleons the carpenter's
broad axe hacked through the cables and left the anchors
deep in Channel mud. Sails were hurriedly shaken out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and like a startled flock of sheep the crowd of ships hurried
away to the eastward along the coast in wild disorder.
Moncada, the admiral of the galleasses, in the "San Lorenzo,"
collided with the galleon "San Juan de Sicilia,"
and the great galleass dismasted and with shattered oars
drifted on a back eddy of the tide towards Calais bar. The
fireships went aground here and there, and burned harmlessly
to the water's edge. Medina-Sidonia, seeing the
danger was over, fired a gun as a signal for the fleet to
anchor, but most of the ships had cut their cables, and had
no spare anchors available on deck, and they drifted along
the coast, some of them as far as Dunkirk. The sunrise
on the Monday morning showed the great fleet widely
scattered, only a few of the best ships being with the
admiral. Moncada's flagship had been left by the falling
tide hard aground on Calais bar.</p>

<p>The English attacked the stranded galleass in pinnaces
and boats, Howard with some of the larger ships standing
by "to give the men comfort and countenance." Some of
the Spaniards escaped to the shore. The rest, headed by
Moncada, made a brave stand against the boarders, who
swarmed up her sides, led by one Richard Tomson, of
Ramsgate. Moncada was killed, and the ship taken. The
English pillaged her, but the hulk was abandoned and
seized later by the French Governor of Calais.</p>

<p>During this fight on the bar Medina-Sidonia had reassembled
about half his fleet, which he formed in a great
crescent off Gravelines. The wind was from the west, and
numbers of galleons were away to leeward. Some of them
were in dire peril of driving ashore. Howard saw his advantage,
and the whole English fleet bore down on the
Spanish crescent. It was the nearest thing to a pitched
battle in the whole Armada campaign. The English came
on with wind and tide helping them and, with the confidence
that was the outcome of their growing sense of superiority,
ventured to close quarters with the tall Spaniards, while
taking care never to give them the chance of grappling and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
boarding. As the fight went on the Spaniards worked
slowly towards the north-east edging off the land, for their
deep draught and the fate of Moncada's galleass made
them anxious about the Flanders shoals.</p>

<p>Howard and Hawkins led the English centre, Drake and
Frobisher the right, Seymour and Winter the left. Not a
shot was fired till they were at musket range, and then the
English guns roared out in a well-sustained cannonade in
which every shot told. It was the first of modern naval
battles, the fights decided by gunfire, not by hand-to-hand
conflict on the decks. The Spaniards answered back with
their lighter and more slowly served artillery, and with a
crackle of musketry fire. Before noon the Spanish cannon
were mostly silent, for sheer lack of ammunition, and the
galleons defended themselves only with musket and
arquebuse, while striving in vain to close and grapple with
their enemies. Spars and rigging were badly cut up, shots
between wind and water were letting the sea into the huge
hulls. Just as the English thought the "San Juan de
Sicilia" had been put out of action and would be their
prize, the galleon heeled over and went to the bottom.
Soon the fight was only sustained by the rearward ships,
the rest trying to extricate themselves from the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, not
for any lack of courage, but because all their ammunition
was gone, their decks were encumbered with wreckage from
aloft, and the men were toiling at the pumps to keep them
afloat.</p>

<p>The English at last drew off from their persistent attacks
on the rearward ships, only because after a hot cannonade
of seven hours they were running short of ammunition; so
they used the advantage of position and better seamanship
and seaworthiness to break off from the battle, Howard
hanging out the "council flag" from the "Ark," as a
signal to his leading captains to come on board and discuss
the situation with him.</p>

<p>Medina-Sidonia, in his diary of the day, says nothing of
the sinking of the "San Juan de Sicilia," but he goes on to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
tell how the "San Felipe" and the "San Mateo" were
seen drifting helplessly towards the shoals of the Zealand
coast; how efforts were made to take off their crews, but
these failed, "for the sea was so high that nothing could be
done, nor could the damage be repaired which the flagship
had suffered from great shot, whereby she was in danger of
being lost." This talk of rough seas shows that, brave
though he undoubtedly was in battle, the Duke had the
landsman's exaggerated alarm at the choppy waves of the
Channel, and regarded as a gale and a storm what a sailor
would call fine weather with a bit of a breeze. None of the
English commanders thought that there was a high sea
that summer afternoon.</p>

<p>In the night it blew somewhat harder from the north-west,
and as the early dawn came it was seen that the
Armada was in a perilous position. The galleons, many of
them with badly damaged spars and rigging, many more
without anchors at their cat-heads ready to bring them up,
were being forced nearer and nearer to the low sandy
shores that were marked only by the white foam of the
breakers, and the leadsmen were giving warning that the
keels were already dangerously near to the shelving bottom
along the outlying fringe of shoals. The English ships,
with plenty of sea-room, looked on without closing in to
attack. Little ammunition was left, and Howard and his
captains were not going to waste good powder and shot on
ships that seemed doomed to hopeless destruction. Some of
Medina-Sidonia's captains proposed that he should show the
white flag and obtain the help of the English to tow the endangered
vessels off the lee shore, but he refused to hear of
such base surrender, and told them he was prepared for
death. He tells in his journal of the day how a sudden
change of the wind saved the fleet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The enemy held aloof, seeing that our Armada must be
lost. The pilots on board the flagship&mdash;men of experience
of that coast&mdash;told the Duke at this time that it was not
possible to save a single ship of the Armada; for that with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the wind as it was in the north-west, they must all needs go
on the banks of Zeeland; that God alone could prevent it.
Being in this peril and without any remedy, God was pleased
to change the wind to west-south-west, whereby the fleet
stood towards the north without hurt to any ship."</p></div>

<p>The deliverance was not quite as complete as the Duke
supposed. Far astern the great "San Mateo" had
grounded on the shoals "between Ostend and Sluys."
Next day three English ships came to take her, but the
Spaniards, notwithstanding their helpless plight, made a
desperate fight for two hours before they surrendered. Don
Diego de Pimentel was in command, with several nobles
among his officers and volunteers. These were spared, for
the sake of the ransom they might fetch, but no quarter
was given to the common crowd. William Borlas, one of
the captors, wrote to Secretary Walsingham: "I was the
means that the best sort were saved; and the rest were
cast overboard and slain at the entry."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> These Elizabethan
sea-fighters were as cruel as they were brave.</p>

<p>Other ships drifted ashore or found their way into ports
along the low coast to the north-eastward, but all these
were taken by Prince Maurice of Nassau, admiral of the
United Provinces, who with some thirty sail gleaned up the
wreckage of the Armada, though he had taken no part in
the fighting, only blockading Parma's flotillas as his share
of the service.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, saved by the shift of the wind, the main body
of the Armada was speeding into the North Sea, led by
Medina-Sidonia in the leaky "San Martin." Howard and
the English fleet held a parallel course, shepherding the
enemy without closing in to fire a single shot. Howard was
again, to use the phrase of the time, "putting on a brag
countenance," for he was in no condition for serious fighting,
even against such crippled opponents. The magazines of
the English fleet were all but empty, its "cannon, demi-cannon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
sakers, and falconets" doomed to useless silence,
food and water short in supply, and much sickness among
the tired crews, who were complaining that they were
badly fed and that the beer was undrinkable.</p>

<p>In the evening Medina-Sidonia held a council of war on
board the "San Martin." Soldiers and sailors, veterans of
many wars, and the chief pilots of the fleet sat round his
cabin table, and there was anxious debate. No one could
say how long it would be before Parma's army was ready;
ammunition and provisions were short, men falling sick,
ships badly damaged, though only a dozen had been actually
lost. The wind was increasing from the south-south-west,
and the pilots urged that the best course was to run up the
North Sea, round the north of Scotland, reach the open
Atlantic, and so return to Spain without further fighting.</p>

<p>Some of the best of the officers, men who had been
throughout in the thick of the fighting, protested against
this course, to which their admiral was evidently inclined.
Recalde, Oquendo, and Leyva spoke for the brave minority.
Most of the great fleet was still safe, and Recalde begged the
Duke to lie off and on till the wind blew fair for the Channel
again, and then risk another fight. Leyva supported him,
and said that though his own ship, the "Rata Coronada,"
had been sorely battered, was leaking like a sieve, and had
only thirty cartridges in her magazine, he would rather
take her into action again and sink fighting than see the
Armada run away northward like a pack of cowards. But
what seemed the easiest course prevailed. Medina-Sidonia
saved his conscience as a soldier by summing up the resolution
of the council as a decision to sail northward, but
turn back and fight if the wind and weather became
favourable.</p>

<p>So in the following days the Armada sped northward
before the south-west wind, which sometimes blew hard and
raised a sea that increased the distress of the Spaniards.
Howard followed with the English fleet, just keeping the
Armada in sight. If the Spanish admiral shortened sail
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to collect his rearward stragglers, Howard followed his
example, making no attempt even to close and cut off the
nearest ships. He was still reluctantly compelled by empty
magazines and half-empty lockers to be content merely
"to put on a brag countenance." His shortness of supplies
forced him at last to lose touch of the enemy. Off the Firth
of Forth he abandoned the pursuit.</p>

<p>When the English ships returned to their ports the
captains were not at all sure what had become of the
Armada. Some thought it might have gone to the harbours
of Norway and Denmark to winter and refit there, and
renew the attempt next spring. One sees in the letters of
Secretary Walsingham the uncertainty that prevailed
among the Queen's counsellors, and some disappointment
that the victory was not more complete, though this was
the result of himself and his colleagues leaving Howard so
ill supplied. On the same day (8 August, Old Style) Walsingham
writes to Lord Burghley: "It is hard now to resolve
what advice to give Her Majesty for disarming, until it
shall be known what is become of the Spanish fleet"; and
to the Lord Chancellor: "I am sorry the Lord Admiral was
forced to leave the prosecution of the enemy through the
wants he sustained. Our half-doings doth breed dishonour
and leaveth the disease uncured."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Armada had held its course to the northward,
sometimes sighted far off from a Scottish headland.
On 20 August (10th, Old Style), twelve days after the battle
off Gravelines, it was passing between the Orkneys and
Shetlands, heading for the Atlantic, helped by a change of
wind which now blew from the east, filling the great sails,
but chilling the southern sailors and soldiers to the bone.
Though it was summer, the cold was like that of winter,
and the bitter weather grew even worse as the galleons
sailed on into the North Atlantic. The great ships straggled
for miles over grey foam-flecked seas, under dull cloud-packed
skies that sent down showers of sleety rain.
Men huddled below in the crowded gundecks, and in fore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and stern castles, and there were days when only the pilots
kept the deck, while gangs of men took their turn at the
never-resting pumps. There were semi-starvation and
fever in every ship. The chaplains were busy giving the
last consolations of religion to dying men, and each day
read the burial service over a row of canvas-shrouded
dead, and "committed them to the deep."</p>

<p>The Armada no longer held together. Small groups
formed haphazard squadrons, keeping each other company,
but many ships were isolated and ploughed their way alone
over the dreary sea. Many, despite hard work at the
pumps, settled lower and lower in the water each day, and
at last sank in the ocean, their fate unknown and unrecorded
till, as the months went by and there was no news of them,
they were counted as hopelessly lost. Of others the fate is
known.</p>

<p>In his sailing instructions Medina-Sidonia had been
warned that he should take "great heed lest you fall upon
the island of Ireland for fear of the harm that may happen
to you on that coast," where, as a sixteenth-century sailor
wrote, "the ocean sea raiseth such a billow as can hardly
be endured by the greatest ships." There was heavy
weather in the "ocean sea" that August and September,
but even so the galleons that steered well to the westward
before shaping their course for Spain, and kept plenty of
sea-room by never sighting the "island of Ireland," succeeded
in getting home, except where they were already so
badly damaged and so leaky that they could not keep
afloat. But along the coasts of Scotland and Ireland there
was a succession of disasters for those who clung to, or were
driven into, the landward waters.</p>

<p>The first mishap occurred when the Armada was rounding
the north of Scotland. The "Gran Grifon," the flagship
of Juan Lopez de Medina, admiral of the <i>urcas</i> or storeships,
drove on the rocks of Fair Isle, the solitary cliff-bound
island in the channel between the Orkneys and Shetlands.
Here such few as escaped the waves lived for some six weeks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in "great hunger and cold." Then a fishing-boat took
them to Anstruther in Fifeshire, where they surrendered to
the bailies. Lopez de Medina was among this handful of
survivors. Melville, the Presbyterian minister of Anstruther,
describes him as "a very reverend man of big
stature and grave and stout countenance, grey haired and
very humble like," as he asked quarter for himself and his
comrades in misfortune.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Other distressed ships fled from the Atlantic storms for
shelter inside the Hebrides. Three entered the Sound of
Mull, where one was wrecked near Lochaline, and a second
off Salen. The third, the great galleass "Florencia," went
down in Tobermory Bay. The local fishermen still tell the
traditional story of her arrival and shipwreck. She lies in
deep water, half-buried in the sand of the bottom, and
enterprising divers are now busy with modern scientific
appliances trying to recover the "pieces of eight" in her
war-chest, and the silver plate which, according to a dispatch
of Walsingham's, was the dinner-service of the
"Grandee of Spain" who commanded her.</p>

<p>But it was on the shores of the "island of Ireland" that
the most tragic disasters of the Armada took place. Its
wrecks strewed the north and west coasts. Fitzwilliam,
the "Deputy" or the Viceroy, in Dublin, and Bingham,
the Governor of Connaught, had taken precautions to prevent
the Spaniards finding shelter, water, and food in the
ports by reinforcing the western garrisons. Bingham feared
the Irish might be friendly to the Spaniards, and industriously
spread among the coast population tales that if they
landed the foreigners would massacre the old and carry the
young away into slavery. The people of the ports, who had
long traded with Spain, knew better, but some of the rude
fisher-folk of the west coast perhaps believed the slander.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Where shipwrecked crews fell into the hands of Bingham's
men no mercy was shown them. He marched four hundred
prisoners into Galway, and his troops massacred them in
cold blood, and then he reported that, "having made a
clean despatch of them both within the town, and in the
country abroad, he rested Sunday all day, giving praise
and thanks to God for Her Majesty's most happy success in
that action, and our deliverance from such dangerous
enemies."</p>

<p>One of the <i>urcas</i> came into Tralee Bay in an almost sinking
condition, with her crew reduced to twenty-three men,
ill and half starved and unable to work the ship. Sir
Edward Denny, the Governor of Tralee Castle, was absent.
The Spaniards surrendered to Lady Denny and her garrison.
The men begged for their lives, and some said they
had friends in Waterford who would pay ransom for them;
but the lady had them all put to the sword, because "there
was no safe keeping for them."</p>

<p>In all, some twenty-five galleons were dashed to pieces
under the giant cliff walls of the Irish coast, or on outlying
skerries and rocky headlands. In a few cases the Irish
coast folk helped the survivors, but too often they were as
cruel as the English, and killed and plundered them. Sir
George Carew wrote to the Queen, rejoicing that there was
now "blood between the Irish and the King of Spain." The
Government troops marched along the coasts hunting for
Spaniards. The Lord-Deputy Fitzwilliam accompanied
one of these parties, and told how in Sligo Bay he saw
miles of wreckage, "timber enough to build five of the
greatest ships that ever I saw, besides mighty great boats,
cables, and other cordage, and some such masts for bigness
and length, as I never saw any two could make the like."
Fitzwilliam fairly revelled in the destruction of the Spaniards.
He wrote to Secretary Walsingham: "Since it hath
pleased God by His hand upon the rocks to drown the
greater and better sort of them, I will, with His favour, be
His soldier for the despatching of those rags which yet remain."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
At last he got tired of this miserable kind of
"soldiering," and proclaimed mercy for all Spaniards in
Ireland who surrendered before 15 January, 1589. Numbers
of ragged and starving men surrendered. Others had
already been smuggled over to Scotland, still an independent
country, where they were well treated and given
transport to Spain.</p>

<p>The gallant Alonso de Leyva, after escaping from the
wreck of his good ship the "Rata Coronada" in Blacksod
Bay, was steering for Scotland in one of the galleasses that
had rescued him and his comrades, when the ship was
driven by a storm against the wild cliffs of Dunluce Castle,
near the Giant's Causeway. The galleass was shattered
to matchwood, and Leyva perished with all on board save
five who swam ashore.</p>

<p>In the last days of September the surviving ships of the
Armada came straggling into the northern ports of Spain
with starving, fever-stricken crews. Medina-Sidonia had
kept some fifty sail together till 18 September. He had resigned
all active duties of command to his lieutenants,
Flores and Bobadilla, for he was ill and broken in spirit.
His hair had whitened, and he looked like an old man, as
he sat all day in the "great cabin" of the "San Martin,"
with his head in his hands. A Biscay gale scattered the
remnant of the Armada, and on 21 September the "San
Martin" appeared alone off Santander. The wind had
fallen; her sails hung loose from the yards, and the long
swell that followed the gale was driving the ship towards
the rocks outside the port. Some boats went out and towed
her in. Most of the crew were sick. Nearly two hundred
had been buried at sea.</p>

<p>Recalde and Oquendo brought their ships home, but
landed broken with the hardships of the terrible voyage,
and only survived it a few weeks. Every ship that arrived
told of the many buried at sea, and landed scores of dying
and fever and scurvy-stricken men, so that all the northern
ports were like great hospitals. When the last galleon had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
struggled into harbour, fifty-five great ships were still
missing. The best of the leaders were dead. Not more than
a third of the sailors and soldiers survived. It was a disaster
from which Spain as a naval power never really recovered.
For fifty years to come the Spanish infantry still
upheld their claim to be invincible on the battlefield, but
the tall galleon had ceased to be the mistress of the seas.</p>

<p>The campaign of the Armada is remarkable not only for
inaugurating the modern period of naval war, the era of the
sail and the gun, but also because, though it ended in disaster
for one side and success for the other, there was from
first to last in the long series of engagements in the narrow
seas no battle "fought to a finish." In all the fighting the
English showed that they had grasped the essential ideas
of the new warfare, and proved themselves better sailors
and better gunners, but the number of the ships they took
or destroyed was insignificant. Howard was so crippled
by parsimonious mismanagement on the part of his Government
that he had to be content with "half-doings," instead
of decisive results. But there was worse mismanagement
on the Spanish side, and this led first to failure, then
to disaster.</p>

<p>The story of the Armada is full of useful lessons, but for
England its message for all time is that her true defence
against invasion lies not in armies, but upon the sea. The
Elizabethan captains knew well that if once Parma's
veterans landed in Kent or Essex, the half-trained levies
gathered by the beacon fires could do little to stop their
onward march. So they took care to make the narrow
seas an impassable barrier to the enemy by harrying the
covering fleet and making it hopeless for Parma even to
think of sending his transports to sea. The lesson is worth
remembering even now.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="title">
THE BATTLE OFF THE GUNFLEET<br />
1666</p>


<p>The decline of Spain as a great power was largely due
to the unsuccessful attempt to coerce the Dutch
people. Out of the struggle arose the Republic of the
United Provinces, and Holland, won from the sea, and
almost an amphibious state, became in a few years a great
naval power. A hardy race of sailors was trained in the
fisheries of the North Sea. Settlements were established
in the Far East, and fleets of Dutch East Indiamen broke
the Spanish monopoly of Asiatic trade. It was to obtain
a depot and watering-place for their East Indiamen that
the Dutch founded Cape Town, with far-reaching results
on the future development of South Africa.</p>

<p>A Dutch fleet had assisted in defeating the Armada, but
the rise of this naval power on the eastern shores of the
narrow seas made rivalry with England on the waters inevitable.
In the seventeenth century there was a series of
hard-fought naval wars between England and the United
Provinces.</p>

<p>Under the two first Stuart Kings of England there were
quarrels with the Dutch that nearly led to war. The Dutch
colonists and traders in the Far Eastern seas had used
high-handed measures to prevent English competition.
Nearer home there were disputes as to the right claimed
by the King's ships to make any foreign ship lower her
flag and salute the English ensign. But it was not till the
days of the Commonwealth that the first war broke out.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
It was a conflict between two republics. Its immediate
cause was Cromwell's Navigation Act, which deprived the
Dutch of a considerable part of their carrying trade. The
first fight took place before the formal declaration of war,
and was the result of a Dutch captain refusing the customary
salute to a Commonwealth ship.</p>

<p>In this, as in the later conflicts with Holland, while
England was still able to live on its own products, the
Dutch were in the position in which we are now, for the
command of the sea was vital to their daily life. Their
whole wealth depended on their great fishing fleets in the
North Sea; their Indiamen which brought the produce of
the East to Northern Europe through the Straits of Dover;
and the carrying trade, in which they were the carriers of
the goods of all Central Europe, which the Rhine and their
canals brought into their ports. The mere prolongation of
a naval war meant endless loss to the merchants and shipowners
of Holland.</p>

<p>The development of ocean-borne commerce had led to
great improvements in shipbuilding in the three-quarters
of a century since the days of the Armada, and the fleets
that met in the Channel and the North Sea during Cromwell's
Dutch war were far more powerful than those of Medina-Sidonia
and Howard. The nucleus of the English fleet had
been formed by the permanent establishment created by
Charles&nbsp;I, but the ships for which he had levied the "Ship
Money" were used against him in the Civil War, for the
seafaring population and the people of the ports mostly
sided with the Parliament. The operations against Rupert
in the Mediterranean, the war with the Algerines, and the
expeditions to the West Indies had helped to form for the
Commonwealth a body of experienced officers and seamen,
and in Blake, Cromwell had at least one admiral of the
first rank. The fleets on both sides sometimes numbered
as many as a hundred sail. The guns mounted in broadside
tiers had come to be recognized as the weapons that
must decide a sea-fight, and in this first Dutch war we see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
on both sides attempts to use tactical formations that
would give the best scope to gun power.</p>

<p>Though a battle was always likely to develop into an
irregular m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, in which the boldest exchanged broadsides
and the shirkers hung back, there were attempts to fight
in regular lines, the ships giving each other mutual support.
Want of traditional experience, marked differences
in the speed and man&#0339;uvring power of ships, and the rudimentary
character of the signalling, made it difficult to
keep the line, but it was early recognized as an ideal to be
aimed at.</p>

<p>The old oar-driven galleys, with their heavy batteries
in the bows and all the guns pointing ahead, went into
battle, as at Lepanto, in line abreast. The broadside battleship
would thus have her guns pointed at her consorts.
The line abreast was used only to bear down on the enemy.
The fighting formation was the line ahead. This was
adopted at first as a fleet running down from windward
closed upon its enemy. Unless they were actually running
away, the other side would be sailing in line ahead with the
wind abeam. It was soon realized that in this formation
an admiral had his fleet under better control, and gradually
the normal formation for fleets became line ahead, and
hostile fleets either fought running on parallel courses on
the same tack, or passed and repassed each other on
opposite tacks. But this was the result of a long evolution,
and the typically formal battles fought out by rule in the
"close-hauled line ahead" belong to the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The first Dutch war ended with Blake's victory off the
Kentish Knock. The second war, in the days of Charles&nbsp;II,
is best remembered in England in connection with a
national disgrace, the Dutch raid on Chatham and the
blockade of the Thames. This disaster was the result of a
piece of almost incomprehensible folly on the part of the
King and his advisers. But it came shortly after a great
naval victory, the story of which is by most forgotten. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
is worth telling again, if only to show that the disaster in
the Thames was not the fault of the British navy, and that
even under Charles&nbsp;II there were glorious days for our fleet.
It is also interesting as a typical naval battle of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Hostilities began in 1664 without a formal declaration
of war, the conflict opening with aggressions and reprisals
in the colonial sphere of action. English fleets seized Dutch
trading ships on the African coast and Dutch islands in the
West Indies. In North America the Dutch settlement of
New Amsterdam, at the mouth of the Hudson, was occupied,
annexed, and renamed New York in honour of His
Highness the Duke of York, the brother of the King.
England drifted into the war as the result of conflicts in
the colonies, and was in a state of dangerous unreadiness
for the struggle on the sea. "God knows how little fit we
are for it," wrote Pepys, who as Secretary of the Navy
knew the whole position. There was the utmost difficulty
in obtaining men for the ships that were being got ready
for sea. The pressgangs brought in poor creatures whom
the captains described as a useless rabble. There were
hundreds of desertions. Happily the Dutch preparations
were also backward, and England had thus some breathing
time.</p>

<p>In June the two fleets, under the Duke of York and the
Dutch Admiral Opdam, each numbering nearly a hundred
sail, were in the North Sea, and on the 3rd they met in
battle, some thirty-five miles south-east of Lowestoft.
Opdam was driven back to the Texel with the loss of
several ships. The Duke of York had behaved with
courage and spirit during the fight, and was covered with
splashes of the blood of officers killed beside him on the
quarter-deck, where he himself was slightly wounded. But
he showed slackness and irresolution in the pursuit, and
failed to reap the full results of his victory.</p>

<p>During the rest of the summer there were more or less
successful enterprises against Dutch trade; but the plague
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in London, in the ports and dockyards, and even in the
fleet itself, seriously interfered with the prosecution of the
war. As usual at that time, the winter months were practically
a time of truce. In the spring of 1666 both parties
were ready for another North Sea campaign.</p>

<p>The Dutch had fitted out more than eighty ships under
Admiral De Ruyter, and the English fleet was put under
the command of Monk, Duke of Albemarle, with Prince
Rupert, the fiery cavalry leader of the Civil War, as his
right-hand man. Both were soldiers who had had some
sea experience. It was still the time when it was an ordinary
event for a courtier to command a battleship, with a
sailor to translate his orders into sea language and look
after the navigation for him. Pepys tells how he heard
Monk's wife, the Duchess of Albemarle (perhaps echoing
what her husband had said in private), "cry mightily out
against the having of gentlemen captains, with feathers
and ribbons, and wish the King would send her husband
to sea with the old plain sea-captains that he served with
formerly."</p>

<p>Monk and Rupert went to join the fleet that was assembling
at the Nore on 23 April. It was not ready for sea
till near the end of May. On 1 June, when part of the
fleet was detached under Rupert to watch the Straits of
Dover, Monk met De Ruyter (who was in superior force)
off the Essex coast and began a battle that lasted for four
days. The news of the first day's fighting set London rejoicing,
but soon there came disappointing reports of
failure.</p>

<p>The four days' battle had ended in defeat. Outnumbered
as he was, Monk had made a splendid fight on
the first two days, hoping from hour to hour for Rupert's
arrival. On the third day, the Sunday, he had to retire
towards the Thames, covering his retreat with a rearguard
of sixteen of his best ships. Several of these touched on
the Galloper Sand, and Ascue's ship, the "Prince," ran
hard aground on the bank. Ascue struck his flag, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Dutch burned his ship, abandoning an effort to carry her
off because at last Rupert's squadron was in sight. On the
fourth day a confused m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of hard fighting off the Thames
mouth ended in Monk retiring into the river. He had lost
twenty ships and some three thousand men; but he had
fought so well that the Dutch bought their victory dearly,
and, after attempting for a few days to blockade the
Thames, had to return to Holland to refit and make good
their losses.</p>

<p>Amid the general discouragement at the failure of the
fleet there was an outburst of mutual accusations of misconduct
among the captains, and even some bitter attacks
on Monk, the "General at Sea." Fault was found with the
dividing of the fleet on a false report; with Monk's haste
to attack the Dutch when he was short of ships; and,
finally, with his retreat before the enemy into the Thames.
Monk, however, did not bear himself like a beaten man.
He spoke of the long battle as, at the worst, an indecisive
engagement, and said he had given the Dutch as many
hard knocks as he had taken, and now knew how to defeat
them. He had sufficient influence at Court to be able to
retain his command, and so could look forward to trying
his fortune again before long.</p>

<p>The work of refitting the fleet was taken in hand. At
any cost, the danger of a blockade of the Thames must be
averted, so the merchants of the City combined to help
with money, and even some of the rich men of the Court
loosed their purse-strings. A fine three-decker launched at
Chatham was named the "Loyal London," in compliment
to the exertions of the City, and work was pushed on so
rapidly that she was soon ready for commission. Many of
the ships had been shorthanded in the four days' battle.
The pressgangs were now set vigorously to work, and,
though there was a constant drain of desertions to contend
with, the numbers on board the ships at Chatham and in
the lower Thames rose day by day.</p>

<p>At the end of June a new impetus was given to the preparations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
by the reappearance of De Ruyter's fleet. He
had repaired damages more quickly than his opponents,
and put to sea to blockade the Thames. It was on 29 June
that the fishermen of Margate and Broadstairs saw a great
crowd of strange sail off the North Foreland. It was the
Dutch fleet of over a hundred ships, great and small, and
commanded by De Ruyter, Van Tromp, and Jan Evertszoon.
Some of the ships stood in close to Margate. The
militia of the county was called out, and the alarm spread
along the southern coast, for the rumour ran that the
Dutch had come to cover a French invasion. But no
Frenchmen came, and the Hollanders themselves did not
send even a boat's crew ashore. They were quite satisfied
with stopping all the trade of London by their mere presence
off the Thames, and they had the chance too of picking
up homecoming ships that had not been duly warned.
So, favoured by fine summer weather, the Dutch admirals
cruised backwards and forwards in leisurely fashion between
the North Foreland and the outer end of the Gunfleet
Sand. They watched with their light craft all the
channels that traverse the tangle of sandbanks and shallows
in the estuary of the river; but their main fleet was
generally somewhere off the Essex coast, for on that side
of the estuary lay the channels then best known and most
used, the Swin and the Black Deep.</p>

<p>The fleet which thus for some three weeks held possession
of the very gateway to the Thames numbered seventy-three
line-of-battle ships, twenty-six frigates, and some
twenty light craft fitted to be used as fireships. By great
exertions Monk and Rupert had got together in the lower
Thames eighty-seven fighting-ships and a squadron of fireships.
Some fifteen more frigates might have been added
to the fleet, but it was thought better to leave them unmanned,
and use their crews for strengthening those of the
larger ships. The fleet assembled at the Nore had full
complements this time. The men were eager to meet the
enemy, and numbers of young gallants from the Court had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
volunteered for service as supernumeraries. The "Loyal
London," fresh from the builders' hands at Chatham yard,
with her crew of eight hundred men, was said to be "the
best ship in the world, large or small." Pepys noted that
it was the talk of competent men that this was "much
the best fleet, for force of guns, greatness and number of
ships, that ever England did see." England had certainly
need of a good fleet, for she never met on the sea a more
capable and determined enemy than the Dutch. In fact,
the republic of the United Provinces was perhaps the only
state that ever contended on anything like equal terms
against England for the command of the sea.</p>

<p>When at last Monk and Rupert were ready to sail they
had to wait for a favourable wind and tide, and, with the
help of their pilots, solve a somewhat delicate problem.
This problem was something like that which a general on
land has to solve when it is a question of moving a large
force through defiles of which the other end is watched by
the enemy's main army. But it had special complications
that the soldier would not have to take into account.</p>

<p>Monk's fleet sailing in line ahead, the only order in which
it could traverse the narrow channels, would cover about
nine miles from van to rear. There were then no accurate
charts of the Thames estuary such as we now possess, and
the pilots of the time believed the possible ways out for
large ships to be fewer and more restricted than we know
them to be at present. They advised Monk to take his
fleet out from the Nore through the Warp and the West
Swin, which form a continuous, fairly deep channel on the
Essex side of the estuary along the outer edge of the
Maplin Sands. At the outer end of the Maplins a long,
narrow sandbank, known as the Middle Ground, with only
a few feet of water over it at low tide, divides the channel
into two parallel branches, the East Swin and the Middle
Deep. At the end of the Middle Ground these two channels
and a third (known as the Barrow Deep) unite to form the
broad King's Channel (also known as the East Swin), where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
there is plenty of sea room, and presently this again expands
into the open sea.</p>

<p>In those old days of sailing-ships a fleet working its way
out of the narrower channels inside the Middle Deep in
presence of an enemy would court destruction if the whole
of its fighting strength could not be brought out into the
wide waters of the King's Channel on a single tide. If only
part of it got out before the tide turned, the van might be
destroyed during the long hours of waiting for the rearward
ships to get out and join in.</p>

<p>On 19 July Monk brought his ships out to the Middle
Ground, beside which they remained anchored in a long
line till the 21st, waiting for a favourable wind and a full
tide. The ebb flows fast through the narrows from west to
east, and weighing shortly before high water on the 22nd,
the fleet spread all sail to a fair wind, and led by the "Royal
Charles" with Monk and Rupert on her quarter-deck, the
long procession of heavy battleships worked out into King's
Channel, soon helped by a racing ebb. Those who saw the
sight said that no finer spectacle had ever been witnessed
on the seas, and certainly England had never till then
challenged battle with a more powerful fleet. Officers and
men were in high spirits and confident of victory, Rupert
as eager as when in his younger days he led his wild charges
of cavaliers, Monk impatient with prudent counsels urged
by timid pilots, and using sharp, strong language to encourage
them to take risks which he as a landsman did
not appreciate. Not a ship touched ground. Some Dutch
ships were sighted on the look-out off the edge of the
Gunfleet, but they drew off when Captain Elliot, in the
"Revenge," led a squadron of nine ships-of-the-line and
some fireships to attack them. De Ruyter, who had been
waiting with his main fleet off the Naze, stood out to sea,
having no intention of beginning a battle till there were
long hours of daylight before him. As the sun went down
the English fleet anchored in the seaward opening of the
King's Channel, with the "Royal Charles" near the buoy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that marked the outer end of the Gunfleet Sands, and on
both sides men turned in with the expectation of hard
fighting next morning.</p>

<p>At daybreak the English fleet weighed anchor. The
Dutch fleet was seen some miles to seaward and more to
the south, sailing in three divisions in line ahead. Evertszoon
was in command of the van; De Ruyter of the centre;
Van Tromp of the rear. There were more than a hundred
sail. Monk stood towards them before a light breeze, challenging
battle in the fashion of the time with much sounding
of trumpets and beating of drums. But De Ruyter
kept his distance, working to the southward outside the
tangle of shallows in the Thames estuary. All day the
fleets drifted slowly, keeping out of gunshot range. Towards
evening the wind fell to a sullen calm with a cloudy
sky, and Monk and De Ruyter both anchored outside the
Long Sand. After sunset there came a summer storm,
vivid flashes of lightning, heavy thunder-peals, and wild,
tempestuous gusts of wind. The anchors held, but Monk
lost one of his best ships, the "Jersey." She was struck
by lightning, which brought down a mass of spars and
rigging on her decks, and so crippled her that she had to
leave the fleet at dawn.</p>

<p>The Dutch fleet had disappeared. De Ruyter had
weighed anchor during the storm and run out to sea.
Monk suspected that he had gone back to his old cruising
ground off the Naze, and when the wind fell and the weather
cleared up in the afternoon of the 24th he weighed and
sailed for the end of the Gunfleet to look for the enemy in
that neighbourhood. He found no trace of him, and
anchored again off the Gunfleet that evening, getting under
way again at two in the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>De Ruyter's light craft had kept him informed of Monk's
movements. The Dutch admiral had avoided battle, when
it was first offered, because he hoped to man&#0339;uvre for the
weather gage, but the failing wind before the storm had
made it hopeless to attempt to work to windward of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
English. At a council of war held on board De Ruyter's
flagship on the evening of the 24th it was decided to accept
battle next day, even if the Dutch had to fight to leeward.
When the sun rose the two fleets were in sight, "eight
leagues off the Naze," De Ruyter in his old position to seaward
and southward of Monk.</p>

<p>The English "general at sea" had <span class="ins" title="ninety two">ninety-two</span> battleships
and seventeen fireships at his disposal. Following the
custom of the time, the English was, like the Dutch fleet,
organized in three divisions. The van, distinguished by
white ensigns, was commanded by Sir Thomas Allen; the
centre, or red division, flew the red ensign (now the flag
of our merchant marine), and was under the personal
command of Monk and Rupert; the rear, under Sir Jeremy
Smith, flew the blue ensign. Battles at sea were now beginning
to be fought under formal rules which soon developed
into a system of pedantic rigidity. It was a point
of honour that van should encounter van; centre, centre;
and rear, rear. The Dutch were moving slowly under
shortened sail in line ahead to the south-east of the English.
Monk formed his fleet in line abreast on the port tack. The
orders were that as they closed with the enemy the ships
were to bear up on to a course parallel to that of the Dutch
and engage in line ahead, division to division and broadside
to broadside. Training cruises and fleet man&#0339;uvres
were still things of a far-off future, and the ships of Monk's
three divisions were all unequal in speed and handiness, so
the man&#0339;uvre was not executed with the machine-like
regularity of a modern fleet. The van and centre came into
action fairly together, but the rearward ships straggled into
position, and Tromp was able to give some of the first
comers a severe hammering before their consorts came into
action and relieved them of some of the brunt of his fire.</p>

<p>The first shots had been fired between nine and ten a.m.
Till after two in the afternoon there was a close engagement,
a steady, well-sustained cannonade, with no attempt
at man&#0339;uvring on either side, the fleets drifting slowly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
before the light wind, wrapped in powder smoke, in the
midst of which both sides made attempts to use their fireships
against each other. The only success was secured by
the Dutch, who set the "Resolution" ablaze. She drifted
out of the line and burned to the water's edge after her
crew had abandoned her. There was heavy loss of life in
both fleets.</p>

<p>For want of anything but the most rudimentary system
of signalling, admirals had little control of a fight once it
was begun. Monk, in the "Royal Charles," had to content
himself with marking out De Ruyter's flagship, the "Seven
Provinces," as his immediate opponent, and fighting a
prolonged duel with her. He walked his quarter-deck
chewing tobacco, a habit he had acquired as a precaution
against infection during the London plague. He spoke at
the outset with undeserved contempt of his opponent.
"Now," he said, "you shall see this fellow come and give
me two broadsides and then run." But De Ruyter's broadsides
thundered for hour after hour. However, the dogged
persistency of the Dutch was met with persistent courage
as steady as their own.</p>

<p>London listened anxiously to the far-off rumbling of the
cannonade on the North Sea waters. Mr. Pepys went to
Whitehall and found the Court "gone to chapel, it being
St. James's Day." Then he tells how&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"by and by, while they are at chapel and we waiting
chapel being done, come people out of the park, telling us
that the guns are heard plainly. And so everybody to the
park, and by and by the chapel done, the King and Duke
into the bowling-green and upon the leads, whither I went,
and there the guns were plain to be heard; though it was
pretty to hear how confident some would be in the loudness
of the guns, which it was as much as ever I could do to hear
them."</p></div>

<p>All the Eastern counties must have heard the cannon-thunder
droning and rumbling like a far-off summer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
storm through the anxious hours of that July day. As the
afternoon went on even Dutch endurance found it hard to
stand up against the steadily sustained cannonade of
Monk's centre and van divisions, and De Ruyter and
Evertszoon began to make sail and work further out to sea,
as if anxious to break off the fight. Monk, Rupert, and
Allen, with the White and Red Divisions, followed them
up closely, making, however, no attempt to board, but
keeping up the fire of their batteries, and waiting for a
chance to capture any crippled ship that might fall astern.
Four of the enemy were thus taken. So the main bodies of
both fleets worked out into the North Sea on parallel
courses, making no great way, for the wind was falling.</p>

<p>The rear divisions, Tromp's and Jeremy Smith's ships,
did not follow the general movement, for Tromp had never
quite lost the advantage he had gained in the opening
stage of the battle. He kept his ships under shortened sail,
and hammered away doggedly at the Blue Division. This
was the moment when Monk might well have either reinforced
Smith, or turned with all his force on Tromp, and
overwhelmed and destroyed his squadron. It was made up
of twenty-five line-of-battle ships and six frigates, and its
loss would have been a heavy blow to Holland. But on sea
as on land there was still little of the spirit of ordered combination.
Just as Rupert at Marston Moor had destroyed
the opposing wing of the Roundheads with a fierce charge
of his cavaliers, and then pursued, without a thought
of using his advantage to fall upon the outnumbered and
exposed centre of the enemy, so now Monk and Rupert
pressed upon De Ruyter and Evertszoon, though Tromp
was at their mercy, and Smith was in serious peril. Thus
the engagement broke into two separate battles as the
summer evening drew on.</p>

<p>Darkness ended the fight, and in the night the wind fell
almost to a calm. Sunrise on the 26th showed the fleets
drifting in disorder on a smooth sea, with their heavy sails
hanging loose from the yards, only filled now and then by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
disappointing flaws of wind. The crews were busy repairing
damages and transferring the wounded to the lighter craft.
All day the only shots fired were discharged by a
couple of brass toy cannon mounted on a pleasure yacht
which Rupert had brought with him. Taking advantage
of a mere ruffle of wind, so light that it could not move the
big ships, the Cavalier Prince ran his yacht under the stern
of the huge flagship of De Ruyter, and fired into him. The
Dutchman had no guns bearing dead aft, and the Prince
was able to worry him for a while, till there came one of
those stronger gusts of wind that filled the sails of the
"Seven Provinces," and she swung round, showing a
broadside that could blow the yacht out of the water. But
before a gun could be fired the yacht, with all sails spread,
was racing back to the English fleet, and Rupert returned
to the "Royal Charles" as pleased as a schoolboy with
his frolic.</p>

<p>During the night of the 26th the wind rose, and De
Ruyter steered for the Scheldt, followed up by Monk's two
divisions. The Dutch admiral covered his retreat with his
best ships, and a running fight began at dawn. Even before
the sun rose the sounds of a heavy cannonade had come
through the darkness, telling that Tromp and Smith were
hard at it again in their detached battle. Early in the day
Monk abandoned the chase of the Dutch, and steered
towards the sound of the cannonade. Soon the fleet came
in distant sight of the battle. Tromp with the "Zealand
squadron" was making a dogged retreat, working to the
south-east, close-hauled on the wind from the north-east.
Monk tacked and made more than one attempt to place
himself across the course of the Dutchmen, hoping to catch
them between his fleet and Smith's Blue Division as between
hammer and anvil. But Tromp slipped between his enemies
and was before long in full sail for Holland, with the three
English divisions combined in a stern chase. Monk said
that if Smith had pressed Tromp closer early in the day, his
retreat would have certainly been cut off. Smith and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
friends protested that if the "general at sea" had laid his
fleet on a better course, Tromp would have been taken. The
honours of this last move in the game were with the Dutchman.</p>

<p>A substantial victory had been gained, though there were
few trophies to show for it. The enemy had been met and
forced by sheer hard knocks to abandon his station off the
mouth of the Thames, and take refuge in his own ports.
Monk was on the Dutch coast, picking up returning
merchantmen as prizes, blockading the outgoing trade, and
keeping the great fishing fleet in ruinous idleness. With
the help of information supplied by a Dutch traitor, Monk
reaped further advantage from his victory and inflicted
heavy additional loss on the enemy. On 8 August the fleet
sailed into the roadstead behind the long island of Terschelling,
one of the chain of islands at the mouth of the
Zuyder Zee, and burned at their anchors a hundred and
sixty Dutch merchantmen that had taken shelter there,
including several great East Indiamen. Next day landing-parties
burned and plundered the ranges of warehouses on
the island, and destroyed the town of Terschelling. The
loss to the Dutch traders was estimated at over a million
sterling.</p>

<p>The victorious battle off the Thames in July, 1666, is
practically forgotten, so far as the popular tradition of our
naval successes goes. It has not even a name by which it
might live in the memory of our people. But it practically
broke the power of Holland and brought the war to an end.
What men do remember, and what has banished from their
minds the living tradition of the great North Sea battle, is
the ugly fact that in the following year De Ruyter sailed
unopposed into the Thames, and captured and burned in
the Medway dismantled ships that had fought victoriously
against him in the North Sea battle&mdash;the "Royal Charles"
being among his prizes.</p>

<p>The fleets had, as usual at the time, been laid up for the
winter. The money available for fitting them out in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
following spring was diverted to other purposes and
squandered by the King and the Court. Charles counted
on having no need to commission a great fleet in the
summer. He knew the Dutch were feeling the strain of the
war and the destruction of their trade, and would soon
have to patch up a peace, and he opened preliminary
negotiations. Such negotiations must be prudently
backed by an effective force on the war footing. The King
had practically disarmed as soon as there was a prospect
of peace. But the Dutch had fitted out the fleet in view of
possible contingencies, and De Witt and De Ruyter could
not resist the temptation of revenging the defeat of 1666
and the sack of Terschelling by a raid on the Thames and
Medway. It was the dishonesty and incapacity of the King
and his parasite Court that laid England open to the shameful
disaster that dimmed for all time the glory of Monk and
Rupert's victory. But even after De Ruyter's exploits at
Chatham the Dutch had no hope of continuing the war, and
within a few weeks of the disaster peace was signed at
Breda. The story of the Dutch raid is a lasting lesson on
the necessity of an island power never for a moment relaxing
the armed guard of the sea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="title">
THE BATTLE OF THE SAINTS' PASSAGE<br />
1782</p>


<p>In the days when fleets in action relied upon the oar, all
fighting was at close quarters, and, as we have seen
in our study of typical battles of this period, naval engagements
fought out at close quarters gave very definite
results, the fleet that was defeated being practically
destroyed.</p>

<p>When battles began to be fought under sail, with the gun
as the chief weapon, a new method had to be evolved. The
more the fire of broadside batteries was relied upon, the
greater was the tendency to fight at short artillery range,
without closing to hand-to-hand distance, and when the
sailors and sea-fighters of the seventeenth century adopted
line ahead as the normal formation for making the most of
broadside fire, battles had a marked tendency to degenerate
into inconclusive artillery duels.</p>

<p>In both the English and the French navies&mdash;the two
powers that after the naval decline of Spain and Holland
disputed the command of the sea&mdash;the tactics of the battle
in line ahead soon crystallized into a pedantic system. For
a hundred years the methods of English admirals were kept
in rigid uniformity by a code of "Fighting Instructions for
the Navy," drawn up under the direction of the Duke of
York (afterwards James&nbsp;II), when he was still Lord High
Admiral of England in his brother's reign. These instructions
were a well-meant attempt to provide a "sealed
pattern" for naval engagements. They contemplated set,
formal battles with both fleets in line ahead, sailing on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
parallel courses, or passing and repassing each other on
opposite tacks, exchanging broadsides as the guns bore.
The French adopted similar methods. If the English had
any advantage in their tactics, it was in their ideas of
gunnery. The French aimed at masts and rigging, in the
hope of crippling an adversary in her sail power and forcing
her to fall out of the moving line. The English believed in
making the hull their target, aiming "between wind and
water" to start dangerous leaks, or sending their shot into
the crowded gun-decks to put the enemy's batteries out of
action.</p>

<p>Under such methods battles became formal duels, in
which, as often as not, there was no great result, and both
sides claimed the victory. The story of many of the naval
campaigns of the first three-quarters of the eighteenth
century is weary reading. It was in the last quarter of the
century that English admirals learned to fight again at close
quarters, and to strike crushing blows at an enemy. The
new period of energetic, decisive fighting began with a
famous battle in West Indian waters in 1782, and culminated
in the world-renowned victories of Nelson, who was a
young captain on the North American station "when
Rodney beat the Comte de Grasse" in the battle of the
Saints' Passage.</p>

<p>Born when George&nbsp;I was King, Rodney was a veteran of
many wars when he won his West Indian triumph. He had
fought the French under Hawke, and was with Boscawen
at the taking of Louisburg. In 1759 he bombarded Havre,
and burned the transport flotilla collected at the mouth of
the Seine for a raid on England. Three years later, as
commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station, he
captured Martinique, St. Lucia, and Grenada, and learned
the ways of the West Indian seas. Then came years of
political disfavour, half-pay and financial embarrassment,
until in an hour of darkness for England, with the American
colonies in successful revolt and Frenchman and Spaniard
besieging Gibraltar by land and sea, the veteran admiral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
was recalled to active service, and found and seized the
great opportunities of his life. Sailing south with a relieving
fleet, he fell in with and captured a Spanish convoy off
Finisterre, and then surprised and destroyed Lungara's
Spanish squadron, taking seven ships out of eleven, and
chasing the rest into Cadiz. The appearance of his fleet
before Gibraltar saved the fortress, and then in February,
1780, he sailed across the Atlantic to try conclusions with
De Guichen, whose powerful fleet based on Martinique
was threatening all the English possessions in the West
Indies. So far numbers and opportunity had been on his
side. He had now to depend more on skill than fortune, and
meet a more equal opponent.</p>

<p>At his head-quarters at St. Lucia in April, 1780, Rodney
heard that the French fleet under De Guichen had sailed
from Martinique. On the 17th he fought an indecisive
action with the enemy, an action notable for what Rodney
attempted, not for what he accomplished. Twice again
on later days Rodney met De Guichen, but none of the
three battles did more than inflict mutual loss on the
combatants, without producing any decisive result. The
campaign was, like so many others in the West Indies, a
struggle for the temporary possession of this or that port
or island, De Guichen's whole strategy being based on the
idea of avoiding the risks of a close engagement that might
imperil his fleet, and trying to snatch local advantages
when he could elude his enemy.</p>

<p>In 1781 Rodney was compelled by ill-health temporarily
to give up the West Indian command and return to England.
In the spring of 1782 he was again sent to the West
Indies, at a moment when the situation of affairs was most
menacing for British power beyond the Atlantic. Cornwallis
had been forced to surrender at Yorktown, and the
success of the revolted American colonies was now assured.
The French fleet in the West Indies had been joined by reinforcements
under the Comte de Grasse, who had gone out
as commander-in-chief, taking with him a considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
military force that was to combine with an expedition
from the Spanish American colonies, not for the capture of
some small islands in the Antilles, but for the conquest of
Jamaica, the centre of British power and British trade in
the West Indian seas.</p>

<p>Kempenfeldt, a good sailor (now remembered chiefly as
the admiral who "went down with twice three hundred
men," when the "Royal George" sank at Spithead),
dispersed and destroyed at the mouth of the Channel a
large French convoy of supplies for De Grasse, and drove
the squadron that protected it into Brest. With his task
thus lightened, Rodney put to sea with four ships of the
line, and after a stormy passage reached Barbadoes on
19 February, 1782. Sailing thence to Antigua, he formed
a junction with and took command of the West Indian
fleet, which Hood had commanded during his absence in
England. From Antigua he took the fleet to St. Lucia,
where he established his head-quarters in Gros Islet Bay.
St. Lucia was the favourite base of operations of our West
Indian fleets in the old wars, and the scene of much desperate
fighting by land and sea. The year before De Grasse
had failed in an attempt to seize it.</p>

<p>The fleet of the Comte de Grasse was only some forty
miles away to the northward. It lay at Martinique, in the
bay of Fort Royal (now Fort de France). Though it has
nothing to do with the fortunes of Rodney and De Grasse,
it is interesting to note that in a convent school looking
out on the bay there was just then a little schoolgirl named
Josephine de la Pagerie, daughter of an artillery lieutenant
in the garrison, who was to live to be Empress of the French,
when France was the mistress of Europe.</p>

<p>During the month of March both fleets were busy preparing
for sea. Rodney was reinforced from England, and
a small squadron from Brest joined De Grasse. The reinforcements
received during March had given Rodney the
advantage of numbers. He had thirty-six sail of the line to
oppose the thirty that were with De Grasse at Martinique.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
In the English fleet there were five great three-deckers,
three of them carrying 98 and two of them 90 guns. There
were twenty-one 74's, a 70-gun ship, and nine 64's. In the
French fleet there was one of the largest war vessels then
afloat, De Grasse's flagship, the "Ville de Paris," of 104
guns. There were five ships of 80 guns, twenty of 74, one
of 70, and three of 64. This enumeration gives Rodney an
advantage of six ships and more than two hundred guns.
It is quite true that the ships of the same rating in the
French service were generally larger than the English,
but even apart from numbers, the latter had advantages
in armament that were more important than any trifling
difference in size. The English guns were mostly mounted
on an improved system that gave a larger arc of training
fore and aft, the practical result being that as ships passed
each other the Frenchman was kept longer under fire than
the Englishman. Further, the English ships mounted,
besides the guns counted in their armament, a number of
carronades, mounted on the upper decks, short guns of
large calibre, throwing a heavy shot when the fighting was
carried on at close quarters, a weapon not yet introduced
in the French navy. Thanks to these improvements in the
armament of his ships, Rodney had an advantage in gun-power
beyond the mere superiority in numbers of ships
and guns. He had a further advantage in the fact that a
larger number of his ships were copper-sheathed. This
meant less fouling while the ships were waiting at their
anchorage, and therefore better speed for the English when
they put to sea.</p>

<p>De Grasse was encumbered with a large convoy of
merchantmen and storeships, and many of his ships were
overcrowded with the troops destined for the descent on
Jamaica. It was expected that when he sailed it would
be to form, in the first instance, a junction with the Spanish
part of the expedition off San <span class="ins" title="Domingo,">Domingo.</span> Rodney kept his
fleet at St. Lucia, ready to weigh anchor on the shortest
notice, and a smart frigate, the "Andromache" (commanded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by Captain Byron, grandfather of the poet),
cruised off Martinique, watching the Frenchman.</p>

<p>At dawn on 8 April Byron saw that the French were
coming out, and he hastened to St. Lucia under press of
sail with the news. Off the port he flew the signal that
told Rodney that De Grasse was at sea. Anchors came up
and sails were shaken out, and Rodney set off in pursuit,
knowing that De Grasse had a very few hours' start of him.</p>

<p>The few hours did not count for much, provided the
English admiral could once get on the Frenchman's track.
The danger of missing him could only arise from making at
the outset a wrong judgment as to the course on which the
enemy would sail. It was De Grasse's business to avoid a
battle until he had safely taken his huge convoy to San
Domingo and joined hands with his Spanish allies. Rodney
judged that he would most likely follow the long curve of
the chain of islands that fringe the Caribbean Sea, steering
by Puerto Rico for San Domingo. In the night of the 8th
the English fleet passed Martinique. Next morning it was
off the west coast of Dominica, making good speed, and
away to the northward a far-spreading crowd of sails
showed that Rodney had guessed rightly. The French
fleet and convoy were in sight.</p>

<p>Dominica is a mass of volcanic ridges, falling to the seaward
in precipitous cliffs, rising landward tier above tier
and shooting up into rocky spires that culminate in the
towering peak of the Morne Diablotin, five thousand feet
high. Under the shelter of this rugged island, while the
prevailing trade wind blows steadily from the eastward,
there are sudden calms, or irregular flaws of wind blowing
now from one point, now from another, diverted by the irregular
ridges of the high land. This April morning the sun
had hardly risen when the wind fell, and the two fleets
drifted slowly, with loose-hanging sails. Near the north
end of the island lay the convoy. A little to the southward
De Grasse's thirty battleships straggled in a long line over
some six miles of sunlit sea. Off the centre and south of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
island Rodney's larger fleet was stretched out in line ahead.
It was formed in three divisions. Hood, in the 90-gun
"Barfleur," commanded the van. Rodney, with his flag
flying in a tall three-decker, the "Formidable," of 98 guns,
was in the centre. The rear was commanded by Rear-Admiral
Samuel Drake, a namesake and descendant of
that other Drake whose name had been the terror of the
West Indian seas in Elizabethan days.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a flaw of wind sweeping from the
south round the end of the island, so narrow that most of
the English fleet hardly felt it. It filled the sails of Hood's
ships in the van, and they steered for two French battleships
that dropped astern of their consorts. One of the
Frenchmen passed close under the tiers of guns in the
leading English ship, but not a shot was fired at her as she
swept by and rejoined her consorts. Rodney had not yet
flown the signal for battle, and these were still the days
when personal enterprise and decision were not encouraged
among the captains of a fleet.</p>

<p>As the breeze filled the sails of the Frenchmen, Grasse
signalled to the convoy to bear away before it to the north-westward,
while he with his fighting-ships set his course
for the channel between Dominica and Guadeloupe. He
rightly judged that Rodney would follow the warships,
and thus the convoy would have a good start. The channel
towards which the French fleet was heading is known as
the Saints' Passage, "not on the surmise that it leads to
Heaven,"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but because along its northern waters stretches
a line of rocky islets known to the French as "<i>les Iles des
Saintes</i>." The nine ships of Hood forming the English van
had gone far ahead of the rest of the fleet. If De Grasse
had not had his mind so centred on the idea of avoiding a
battle, there is little doubt that he might have brought an
overwhelming force to bear on them. Luckily for Rodney,
he contented himself with sending his second in command,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Vaudreuil, to skirmish with them, passing and repassing
Hood's division at long range and firing at masts and
rigging in the hope of disabling them for further pursuit.
Hood returned the fire, doing as much damage as he
suffered, and towards midday the rest of the English had
worked up to him by taking advantage of every breath of
wind that blew over the ridges of Dominica. Then the
wind fell again, and all through the night and the following
day (10 April) the fleets lay in sight of each other beyond
even distant cannon shot, Vaudreuil's and Hood's crews
busying themselves with repairing rigging and replacing
damaged spars.</p>

<p>During the 11th De Grasse tried to get his fleet through
the Saints' Passage, working by short tacks to windward,
and baffled and delayed by sudden calms. In the afternoon
several of his ships were still to the westward of the
strait, and Rodney, who had been getting gradually to the
northward, despite the frequent failure of the wind under
the lee of Dominica, was at last near enough seriously to
threaten these laggards. In order to save them from being
overwhelmed by the whole English fleet, De Grasse gave
up the advantage of weary hours of hard work and came
back before the wind out of the strait. At sunset the two
fleets lay to the westward of the Saints' Passage, and there
was no probability that De Grasse would attempt to tack
through it during the hours of darkness. In the night
Rodney man&#0339;uvred to get to windward of the enemy, and
at daylight on the 12th the two fleets were within striking
distance, De Grasse to the leeward, his fleet in a straggling
line over some nine miles of sea. Rodney had his opportunity
of forcing on a decisive battle at last.</p>

<p>At some distance from the French line a partly dismasted
line-of-battle ship, the "Zel&eacute;," was seen in tow of
a frigate. She had been in collision with the flagship
during the night, and had been so badly damaged that
De Grasse was sending her away to Guadeloupe. Rodney's
ships had lost their order of battle somewhat in the darkness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and while he was reforming his line he detached a
couple of ships to threaten the disabled "Zel&eacute;." This
had the effect he intended. It removed De Grasse's last
hesitation about fighting. The French line was soon seen
bearing down on the port tack, the rearward ships crowding
sail to close up. Rodney's battle line, in reversed order,
led by Drake and the rear division, was already on a course
that would bring the two fleets sweeping past each other,
and the leading ship, the "Marlborough," was steered so
as to make the passage a close one. Rodney had hoisted
the signal to engage the enemy to leeward. While the
fleets were closing he sat in an arm-chair on his quarterdeck,
for he was older than his sixty-four years, broken by
long illness and only sustained by his dogged spirit. One
of his captains, Savage of the "Hercules," also went into
battle seated in an arm-chair beside the bulwarks of his
ship. He was lame with gout and unable to stand or walk
without help. When the firing began, and the ships were
passing each other amid a thunder of broadsides and a hail
of shot and bullets, Captain Savage gravely raised his
cocked hat to salute each enemy as she ranged up abreast
of the "Hercules." What would those old sailors have
thought of the naval commander of to-day peeping through
the slits in the steel walls of a conning tower? But it is
only fair to ask also what they would have thought of
shells weighing half a ton bursting in fiery destruction.</p>

<p>The "Marlborough," approaching on a converging
course, came to close quarters with the "Brave," the sixth
ship in De Grasse's line, and then, shifting her helm to
bring her course parallel to that of the enemy, exchanged
broadsides with the Frenchman. Ship after ship came into
action in the same way. The speed was nearer three than
four knots, and the lines some six miles long, so it was more
than an hour before the leading English battleship was
abreast of and engaged with the rearmost Frenchman.
As ship passed ship there was a thunder of artillery, a rattle
of small arms. Then a brief lull till the guns of two more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
opponents bore on each other. But in this cannonade the
English had the advantage of the heavy blows struck by
their large-bore carronades at close range, and the fact
that their gun-mountings enabled them to keep a passing
ship longer under fire than was possible for the French
gunners. In De Grasse's ships, crowded with troops, the
slaughter was terrible. As the fight went on and the French
ships came under the crushing fire of adversary after adversary,
it was seen that it was only with difficulty the officers
kept the men at the guns. In this first hour of the fight
the French began to throw the dead overboard to clear
their encumbered decks, and a strange horror was added
to the scene, for shoals of sharks that had followed the
fleets to pick up anything thrown overboard now swarmed
around them, lashing the water into foam as they struggled
for their human prey.</p>

<p>At length the leading English ship was abeam of the rearmost
of De Grasse's fleet. Over some six miles of sea the
two battle lines extended, every ship ablaze with fire-flashes
from her guns and with the dense smoke-clouds
drifting around the English vessels and wrapping them in
the fog of war. If the battle was now to be fought out on
the old traditional method, the fleets would clear each
other, wear and tack and repass each other in opposite
directions with a second exchange of fire. But now came
the event that made the battle of the Saints' Passage
epoch-making in naval history.</p>

<p>What precisely happened is wrapped in a fog of controversy
as dense as the smoke-fog that enveloped Rodney's
fleet at the decisive moment. One thing is certain. The
old admiral suddenly changed all his plans, and executed
a new man&#0339;uvre with the signal he himself was disobeying&mdash;the
order to engage to leeward&mdash;still flying from his
flagship. The act was the sudden seizing of an unexpected
opportunity. But some of the merit of the new departure
was due to Rodney's right-hand man, his "Captain of the
Fleet," Sir Charles Douglas. Douglas was one of those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
whose minds had been influenced by new theories on naval
war, which were just then in the air. In Britain a Scotch
country gentleman, John Clerk, of Eldin, had been arguing
for some time in pamphlets and manuscripts circulated
among naval officers against the formal methods that led
to indecisive results. His paper plans for destroying an
enemy were no doubt open to the criticism that they would
work out beautifully if the enemy stuck to the old-fashioned
ways and attempted no counter-stroke. But the essence
of Clerk's theories was that parallel orders of battle meant
only indecisive cannonading; that to crush an enemy one
must break into his line, bring parts of it under a close
fire, not on one side, but on both, and decide the fate of
the ships thus cut off by superior numbers and superior
gun power before the rest could come to their help. His
plans might not work out with the mechanical exactitude
described in his writings, but they would tend to produce
the close m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, where the best men and the steadiest fire
would win, and after such an encounter there would not
be merely a few masts and spars shot away, and a few
holes to be plugged, but the beaten side would be minus a
number of ships sunk, burned, or taken, and condemned to
hopeless inferiority for the rest of the campaign. Clerk
was not the only man who put forward these ideas. A
French Jesuit professor of mathematics had worked out
plans for securing local advantage of numbers in a sea-fight
at close quarters; but while French naval officers
laughed at naval battles worked out with a piece of
chalk and a blackboard, British sailors were either themselves
thinking out similar schemes or were beginning
to think there might be something in the Scotch laird's
diagrams.</p>

<p>It was at the critical moment when the two fleets lay
side by side in parallel lines on opposite courses, wrapped
in the battle-smoke, that Douglas, looking out through a
gap in the war-cloud, saw that a sudden flaw of wind blowing
steadily from the south-east was flattening the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
sails against the masts and checking their speed. The
same sudden change of wind was filling the English sails,
and the masters were squaring the yards to it, while the
Frenchmen to keep any way on their ships had to bring
their bows partly round towards the English line. Between
the "Glorieux," the ship immediately opposed to Rodney's
flagship, the "Formidable," and the next Frenchman in
the line, the "Diad&egrave;me," a wide gap was opening up.
Douglas saw the chance offered to his admiral. Half the
English fleet was ahead of the "Formidable," engaged
with the rearward French ships. If the "Formidable"
pushed through the gap, leading the rest of the line after
her, the French rear would be cut off from the van and
brought under a double fire at close quarters, and there
would be a fair prospect of destroying it before De Grasse
could come back to its support. He rushed to Rodney's
side. Moments were precious. He urged his plan in the
briefest words. At first the old admiral rejected it. "No,"
he said, "I will not break my line."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Douglas insisted,
and the two officers stepped to the opening in the bulwarks
at the gangway and looked out. The "Formidable" was
opposite the tempting gap in the French line. Rodney in
a moment changed his mind, and told Douglas that he
accepted his plan.</p>

<p>In the haste to carry it out the signal to fight to leeward
of the French was forgotten and left flying. The "Formidable"
turned her high bows into the gap, and swept
through it with all her hundred guns and her carronades
in action, pouring broadside after broadside right and left
into the "Glorieux" and the "Diad&egrave;me." Six ships in
succession swung round and followed in the wake of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
flagship, which was now engaged with the French on the
windward side. Shattered by successive blasts of well-directed
fire, the "Diad&egrave;me" was drifting a helpless
wreck, and the rearward ships, with their way checked,
were huddling in confusion behind her, English ships firing
into them on both sides. Through another gap in the
French line, ahead of De Grasse's giant "Ville de Paris,"
other English ships made their way in the dense cloud of
smoke, some of the captains hardly aware of what they
were doing. The French van had meanwhile forged ahead,
and then, as the wind suddenly fell to a dead calm, it was
seen that De Grasse's fleet was broken into three isolated
fragments.</p>

<p>To the southward lay the van ships under De Bougainville
becalmed, with no enemy in range of them. The
"Ville de Paris," with several of her consorts of the French
centre, formed another group, with the whole of the rearward
English division exchanging fire with them at long
range. The rear of the French, under Vaudreuil, and the
ships of the centre cut off by Rodney's man&#0339;uvre were
huddled together, with Hood's division and the ships that
had followed the "Formidable" through the line shepherding
them. The loss of the wind had made it difficult or
impossible to keep the broadsides bearing, and for an hour
the action died down into a desultory cannonade. When
the breeze came again over the ridges of Dominica, De
Bougainville's division, now far to leeward, made no attempt
to succour De Grasse. Only one of his ships slowly
beat up to the main battle. The French admiral tried to
get away to the westward, but Hood clung doggedly to
him, while Rodney and Drake completed the defeat of
Vaudreuil and the French rear. The "Diad&egrave;me" soon
struck her colours. A frigate tried to tow the dismasted
"Glorieux" out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, but the captain of the
"Glorieux," De Kerlessi, saw that the effort would only
end in the friendly frigate being also captured, and with
his own hand he cut the tow-rope and hauled down his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
flag. Then the "C&eacute;sar" struck her colours, and while the
rearward ships were being thus disposed of, in the broken
Centre the "Hector" and the "Ardent" surrendered to
Hood's division.</p>

<p>The English attack was now concentrated on the centre,
and the battle raged fiercely round the French flagship,
distinguished by her huge bulk and her towering masts.
One by one these came down, trailing in a tangle of spars,
sails, and rigging over her sides. Her crowded decks were
a shambles of dead and dying, but still De Grasse fought
on&mdash;for honour, not for victory. His van held aloof, his
broken rear was in flight. Five of his ships had struck.
Still he kept his guns in action till Hood in his flagship,
the "Princesse," ranged close up alongside of him and
poured in a series of destructive broadsides. Then the
French flag came down at last, and De Grasse went on
board the "Princesse" and gave up his sword to the
vice-admiral.</p>

<p>The sun was going down when the French flagship surrendered.
The captured "C&eacute;sar," set on fire by her crew,
was blazing from stem to stern. The other prizes had been
secured. Rodney attempted no pursuit of the scattered
French ships that were sailing away to the southward and
the north-westward. Enough had been done, he said.
It was now his business to refit his fleet and take it to
Jamaica. He had shattered the French power in the West
Indian seas and made himself the master of the field of
operations. A younger and more vigorous man would
have perhaps marked down Vaudreuil's or Bougainville's
fugitive divisions for utter destruction. But Rodney was
content with the solid success he had obtained.</p>

<p>The losses of the French fleet had been very heavy. In
their crowded decks the English fire had effected something
like a massacre. On board the "Ville de Paris" more men
had been killed and wounded than in the whole English
fleet. Very few officers and men had escaped some kind of
wound. Many of the ships that had got away were now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
very shorthanded, with leaking hulls, and spars and rigging
badly cut up.</p>

<p>The effect of the victory was to enable England to
obtain much better terms in the treaty that was signed
next year. A disastrous war was closed by a brilliant
success. But England owed to it more than this temporary
advantage. It was a new beginning, the opening event of
the period of splendid triumphs on the sea on the reputation
of which we are still living. To quote the words of
Rodney's latest biographer,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> "it marked the beginning
of that fierce and headlong yet well-calculated style of sea-fighting
which led to Trafalgar, and made England undisputed
mistress of the sea."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="title">
TRAFALGAR<br />
1805</p>


<p>The closing years of the eighteenth century and the
opening years of the nineteenth represent the most
splendid period in the annals of the British Navy. Howe
destroyed the French fleet in the Atlantic on "the glorious
First of June, 1794," Nelson died in the midst of his
greatest victory off Cape Trafalgar on 21 October, 1805.
Little more than eleven years separated the two dates, and
this brief period was crowded with triumphs for Britain
on the sea. The "First of June," St. Vincent, Camperdown,
the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar are the great
names in the roll of victory; but "the meteor flag of
England" flew victorious in a hundred fights on all the
seas of the world.</p>

<p>Men who were officers young in the service on the day
when Rodney broke at once the formal traditions of a
century and the battle-line of the Comte de Grasse lived
through and shared in the glories of this decade of victory.
A new spirit had come into the navy. An English admiral
would no longer think he had done his duty in merely
bringing his well-ordered line into cannon-shot of an
enemy's array and exchanging broadsides with him at half-cannon
range. Nor was the occupation of a port or an
island recognized as an adequate result for a naval campaign.
The enemy's fighting-fleet was now the object
aimed at. It was not merely to be brought to action, and
more or less damaged by distant cannonading. The ideal
battle was the close fight amid the enemy's broken line,
and victory meant his destruction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>The spirit of the time was personified in its greatest
sailor. Nelson's battles were fought in grim earnest, taking
risks boldly in order to secure great results. Trafalgar&mdash;the
last of his battles, and the last great battle of the days
of the sail&mdash;was also the final episode in the long struggle
of Republican and Imperial France to snatch from England
even for a while the command of the sea.</p>

<p>When Napoleon assembled the Grand Army at Boulogne,
gave it the official title of the "<i>Arm&eacute;e d'Angleterre</i>," and
crowded every creek from Dunkirk to Havre with flat-bottomed
boats for its transport across the Channel, he
quite realized that the first condition of success for the
scheme was that a French fleet should be in possession of
the Channel at the moment his veterans embarked for their
short voyage. He had twenty sail of the line, under
Admiral Ganteaume, at Brest; twelve under Villeneuve
at Toulon; a squadron of five at Rochefort under Admiral
Missiessy; five more at Ferrol; and in this last port and
at Cadiz and Cartagena there were other ships belonging
to his Spanish allies. But every port was watched by
English battleships and cruisers. The vigilant blockade
had been kept up for two years, during which Nelson, who
was watching Toulon, had hardly been an hour absent
from his flagship, the "Victory"; and Collingwood, in
the "Royal Sovereign," did not anchor once in twenty-two
months of alternate cruising and lying to.</p>

<p>Napoleon's mind was ceaselessly busy with plans for
moving his fleets on the sea as he moved army corps on
land, so as to elude, mislead, and out-man&#0339;uvre the English
squadrons, and suddenly bring a concentrated French force
of overwhelming strength into the narrow seas. The first
move in these plans was usually assigned to the Toulon
fleet. According to one project it was to give Nelson the
slip, make for the Straits of Gibraltar, combine with the
Cadiz fleet in driving off or crushing the blockading squadron
before that port, sail north with the liberated vessels,
fall on the blockading ships before Rochefort and Brest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and then sweep the Channel with the united squadrons.
In other projects French fleets were to run the blockades
simultaneously or in succession, raid the West Indies, draw
off a part of the naval forces of England to the other side
of the Atlantic, and then come swooping back upon the
Channel.</p>

<p>In the plan finally adopted the first move was to be the
escape of the Toulon fleet; the second, the threat against
the West Indies. Its execution was entrusted to Villeneuve,
because Napoleon, ever since the escape of his
squadron from the disaster in Aboukir Bay, had regarded
him as "a lucky man," and luck and chance must play a
great part in such a project.</p>

<p>Nelson did not keep up a close and continuous blockade
of Toulon with his fighting-fleet of battleships. He used
Sardinia as his base of supplies, and there were times when
all the heavier ships were in Sardinian waters, while his
frigates watched Toulon. His previous experiences had
led him to believe that if the French Mediterranean fleet
came out it would be for another raid on Egypt, and this
idea was confirmed by reports that Villeneuve was embarking
not only troops, but large quantities of saddlery
and muskets. The story of the saddles seemed to indicate
an expedition to a country where plenty of horses could
be obtained to mount a body of cavalry&mdash;horses, too, that
when they were bought or requisitioned would not have
saddles that a European trooper was used to. Nelson did
not want to keep the French shut up in Toulon. He was
anxious to catch them in the open sea, and with his fleet
on the coast of Sardinia and his frigates spread out in a
fan to the northwards he counted on bringing Villeneuve
to action if he attempted to reach the Levant.</p>

<p>In January, 1805, the frigates brought news that the
French were out, and Nelson at once disposed his fleet to
intercept their expected voyage to Egypt. He found no
trace of them in the direction he expected, and he was
greatly relieved on returning from a hurried rush eastward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to learn that bad weather had driven Villeneuve back to
his port. "These gentlemen," he said, "are not accustomed
to the Gulf of Lyons gales, but we have buffeted
them for twenty-one months without carrying away a
spar."</p>

<p>On 30 March Villeneuve came out of Toulon again with
eleven ships of the line. This time, thanks to Nelson's fixed
idea about Egypt, he got a good start for the Atlantic. As
soon as his frigates brought the news that the French were
out, Nelson strung out his ships from the south point of
Sardinia to Sicily and the African coast. He thus watched
every possible avenue to the Eastern Mediterranean, ready
to concentrate and attack the enemy as soon as he got
touch of them anywhere. But not a French sail was
sighted.</p>

<p>Villeneuve had run down past the Balearic Islands to
Cartagena, where Admiral Salcedo was in command of a
Spanish squadron. But the Spaniards were not ready for
sea, and Villeneuve was anxious to be west of the Straits
of Gibraltar as soon as possible, and could not wait for his
dilatory allies. On 8 April he passed through the Straits.
Then he steered for Cadiz, drove off Sir John Orde's blockading
squadron of six sail, and entered the harbour on
the 9th.</p>

<p>At Cadiz there were Admiral Gravina's Spanish fleet and
a French battleship, the "Aigle." Again the Spaniards
were mostly unready for sea, but six of them and the
"Aigle" joined Villeneuve when he sailed out into the
Atlantic steering for the West Indies, now at the head of
eighteen battleships and seven frigates.</p>

<p>Information was difficult to obtain and travelled slowly
a hundred years ago. It was not till 11 April that Nelson
learned that Villeneuve had passed through the Straits of
Gibraltar eight days before. Then, while the French were
running down into the trade wind that was to carry them
westward, Nelson, still ignorant whether they were raiding
the West Indies or Ireland, but anxious in either case to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
be in the Atlantic as soon as might be, had to work his
way slowly towards the Straits against stormy head winds,
and then wait wearily at anchor on the Moorish coast for a
change of wind that would carry him into the ocean. He
was suffering from disappointment, depression, and ill-health.
It was not till 7 May that he passed the Straits.
He had made up his mind that the French were probably
bound for the West Indies, and he followed them. They
had a long start, but he trusted to find them among the
islands and make the West Indian seas once more famous
for a great British victory.</p>

<p>On 4 June he reached Barbadoes, and began his search,
only to miss the French, thanks to false information, and
learn too late that they were returning to Europe. Villeneuve
had paid only a flying visit to the West Indies,
leaving Martinique on 5 June, the day after Nelson arrived
at Barbadoes, and steering first north, then eastwards
across the Atlantic. Nelson followed on 13 June, and
reached Gibraltar without once sighting his enemy.</p>

<p>He had, however, taken the precaution of dispatching a
fast sailing brig to England with the news that the French
fleet was returning to Europe. This ship, the "Curieux,"
actually got a glimpse of the enemy far off in mid ocean,
and outsailed him to such good purpose that the Admiralty
was able to order the squadrons blockading Brest and
Rochefort to unite under the command of Sir Robert
Calder and try to intercept Villeneuve on his way back.
Though inferior in numbers to the allied fleet, Calder
brought it to action in thick, foggy weather on 22 July,
some ninety miles off the Spanish Cape Finisterre. The
battle, fought in semi-darkness, was a desultory, indecisive
encounter, and though Calder cut off and took two Spanish
ships of the line, the feeling in England, when the news
arrived, was not one of satisfaction at his partial success,
but of undeserved indignation at his having failed to force
the fighting and destroy the enemy's fleet.</p>

<p>Villeneuve took his fleet into Vigo Bay. According to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the plan of campaign, now that he had shaken off Nelson's
pursuit, he should have sailed for the Channel, picking up
the Brest and Rochefort squadrons on his way. Napoleon,
at Boulogne, was ceaselessly drilling the Grand Army in
rapid embarkation and disembarkation, and hoping each
day for news of his admiral's dash into the Channel. But
Villeneuve, who knew Keith had a squadron in the Channel,
and had a vague dread of Nelson suddenly making his
appearance, had a better appreciation of the small chance
of the scheme giving any result than the imperious soldier-Emperor,
who had come to believe that what he ordered
must succeed. From Vigo, Villeneuve wrote to the Minister
of Marine, Decr&egrave;s, that his fleet was hardly in condition
for any active enterprise. It had met with trying weather
in the Atlantic. His flagship, the "Bucentaure," had been
struck and damaged by lightning. All the ships needed a
dockyard overhaul. There was sickness among the crews.
He had to land hundreds of men and send them to hospital.
He wanted recruits badly, and Vigo afforded only the
scantiest resources for the refitting of the ships. He was
already thinking of going back to Cadiz. He moved his
fleet to Corunna, but there he found things in such a condition
that he reported that he could not even find hospital
room for the sick.</p>

<p>From Napoleon came pressing orders to push on to the
Channel at all risks. On 11 August Villeneuve put to sea,
picking up a combined French and Spanish squadron from
the neighbouring port of Ferrol. He meant to sail to
Brest, bring out the squadron there, and call up the ships
at Rochefort by sending on a frigate in advance with
orders for that port. (The frigate was captured on the way
by a British cruiser.) He sent a dispatch overland to
Napoleon to say that at last he was coming.</p>

<p>In the Bay of Biscay, two days out from Corunna, he
was told by a Danish merchant-ship that there was a great
fleet of British battleships close at hand to the northward.
The news was false. A few hours before the captain of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
British cruiser had stopped the Dane and purposely given
him this false information, in the hope that it would reach
the French and mislead them. Except a few scattered
cruisers, there was nothing between Villeneuve and the
ports of Brest and Rochefort&mdash;nothing that could stop his
projected concentration. Nelson had waited a few days
at Gibraltar, where the news of Calder's fight had not
arrived. He communicated with Collingwood, who was
watching Cadiz with six ships, and then, conjecturing that
the object of the French expedition might be Ireland, he
sailed north and was off the Irish coast on 12 August, the
day after Villeneuve left Corunna. Finding no trace of
the enemy, he joined the squadron of Cornwallis off Ushant
on 15 August, and then, broken in health and depressed at
what seemed a huge failure, he went back to England to
spend some time with Lady Hamilton at Merton.</p>

<p>Villeneuve had hardly heard of the imaginary fleet when
the wind, which had so far been fair, went round to the
north. This decided the irresolute admiral. To the dismay
of his captains he suddenly altered his course and ran
before the wind southward to Cadiz, where he arrived on
22 August, contenting himself with watching the retirement
of Collingwood's six ships and making no effort to
envelop and cut them off with his enormously superior
force. Collingwood promptly resumed the blockade when
the French and Spanish anchored, and deluded Villeneuve
into the belief that the blockade was in touch with a supporting
fleet by keeping one of his ships well out in the
offing, and frequently signalling through her to imaginary
consorts below the horizon.</p>

<p>On the very day that Villeneuve anchored at Cadiz,
Napoleon sent off from Boulogne this pressing dispatch to
him at Brest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Admiral, I trust you have arrived at Brest. Start at
once. Do not lose a moment. Come into the Channel with
our united squadrons, and England is ours. We are all
ready. Everything is embarked. Come here for twenty-four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
hours and all is ended, and six centuries of shame and
insult will be avenged."</p></div>

<p>When he heard that the admiral had lost heart and turned
back he was furious. But he had already formed plans for
an alternative enterprise. The English ministry had succeeded
in forming a new coalition with Austria and Russia
as a means of keeping the Emperor occupied on the Continent.
On 27 August Napoleon issued his orders for the
march of the Grand Army to the Danube, and on 1 September
he started on the career of victory, the stages of
which were to be Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, and Friedland.</p>

<p>To Villeneuve he sent, through Decr&egrave;s, bitter reproaches
and new orders for a naval campaign in the Mediterranean.
Decr&egrave;s, writing to his old comrade, transmitted the new
plan of campaign and softened down the Emperor's angry
words. Villeneuve reported that he could not leave Cadiz
for some time. He was doing all that was possible to refit
his fleet and find full crews for the French and Spanish
ships. For the latter men were provided by pressing landsmen
into the service. "It is pitiful," wrote a French
officer, "to see such fine ships manned with a handful of
seamen and a crowd of beggars and herdsmen." In the
councils of war held at Cadiz there were fierce disputes
between the French and Spanish officers, the latter accusing
their allies of having abandoned to their fate the
two ships lost in Calder's action. The jealousy between
the two nations rose so high that several French sailors
were stabbed at night in the streets.</p>

<p>The English Government knew nothing of the inefficient
state and the endless difficulties of the great fleet concentrated
at Cadiz, and regarded its presence there as a standing
danger. Collingwood was reinforced, and it was decided
to send Nelson out to join him, take over the command,
blockade the enemy closely, and bring him to action
if he ventured out.</p>

<p>Nelson sailed from Spithead on 15 September in his old
flagship the "Victory," accompanied by the "Euryalus,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Captain Blackwood, one of the swiftest and smartest
frigates in the navy. Picking up the battleships "Thunderer"
and "Ajax" on the way, he joined the fleet off
Cadiz on 28 September.</p>

<p>Villeneuve had written to Decr&egrave;s that none of the ships
were in really good order, and that the Spanish vessels
were "quite incapable of meeting the enemy." Only a
portion of his fleet had had the slight training afforded by
the Atlantic voyage. The rest had lain for years in harbour,
and many of them had crews chiefly made up of
recently enrolled landsmen. Many of the captains held
that if there was to be a fight it would be useless to man&#0339;uvre
or to attempt an artillery duel, and that the only
chance of success lay in a hand-to-hand fight by boarding.
But, then, to produce the position for boarding meant
being able to man&#0339;uvre. Villeneuve was supported by
most of the superior officers of the fleet in the opinion that
he had better stay at Cadiz; but from Napoleon there
came reiterated orders for the fleet to enter the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The last hesitation of the unfortunate admiral was ended
by the news that Admiral Rosilly was coming from Paris
to supersede him. If he did not attempt something, his
career would end in disgrace. He held a final council of
war, gave his last instructions to his officers, and then wrote
to Decr&egrave;s that he would obey the Emperor's orders, though
he foresaw that they would probably lead to disaster.</p>

<p>Contrary winds from the westward delayed his sailing
for some days after this decision. Reefs and local currents
made it difficult to work a large fleet out of Cadiz without
a fair wind. A smaller but better-trained fleet than that
of Villeneuve had once taken three days to get out, and a
portion of the fleet at sea and unsupported would be in
deadly peril. On 17 October the wind began to work
round to the eastward. Next day it fell almost to a calm,
but it increased towards evening, and Villeneuve, after a
conference with his Spanish colleague, Admiral Gravina,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
signalled that the ships were to weigh anchor at sunrise
on the 19th.</p>

<p>Nelson had been watching Cadiz for three weeks, keeping
his fleet well out at sea, with his frigates close in to the
port, and a chain of ships acting as connecting links with
them to pass on information by signalling with flags by
day and lanterns by night. The system of signalling had
been lately so improved that it was fairly rapid and reliable,
and Nelson kept his fleet out of sight, and requested
that the names of ships sent to reinforce him should not
appear in the papers, as he hoped to delude Villeneuve
into a false idea that he had a very inferior force before
Cadiz. He feared that if the whole array of his fleet were
visible from the look-out stations of the port the allies
would remain safe at anchor. During this period of waiting
he had had more than one conference with his captains,
and had read and explained to them a manuscript memorandum,
dated 9 October, setting forth his plans for the
expected battle. His plan of battle excited an enthusiasm
among them, to which more than one of them afterwards
bore testimony. They said that "the Nelson touch" was
in it, and it is generally taken for granted that they saw
in it something like a stroke of genius and a new departure
in tactics. I hope it is not presumption on my part to
suggest that their enthusiasm was partly the result of
their seeing that their trusted leader was thoroughly himself
again and, to use a familiar phrase, meant business,
and they had a further motive for satisfaction in seeing
how thoroughly he relied on them and how ready he was
to give them a free hand in carrying out his general ideas.</p>

<p>The "Nelson touch" memorandum of 9 October and
the whole plan of the battle have been, and still are, the
subject of acute controversy, the various phases of which
it would be far too long to discuss. It is strange that after
the lapse of a hundred years and the publication of a vast
mass of detailed evidence&mdash;British, French, and Spanish&mdash;there
are still wide differences of opinion as to how the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
most famous naval battle in history was actually fought
out. There is even much uncertainty as to the order in
which the British ships came into action.</p>

<p>The memorandum shows that Nelson originally contemplated
a formation in three lines, an advanced division to
windward, a main division under his personal command,
and a lee division under his second-in-command, Collingwood.
The final grouping of the ships in the battle was in
two divisions. In the following list of the British fleet the
names of ships are arranged in the same order in which they
appear in Collingwood's dispatch, written after the action:&mdash;</p>

<p>This was the fleet that lay off Cape Sta. Maria, some
fifty miles from Cadiz, on Saturday, 19 October, 1805, and
received from the frigates watching the port the message,
passed on by connecting ships, that the enemy was at last
coming out.</p>

<p>Villeneuve, like Nelson, had originally divided his fleet
into three divisions. On the day of battle it fought in an
order which was (as we shall see) partly the result of
chance, arrayed in a long double line. He had deliberately
mixed together in his array the French and Spanish units
of his fleet, to avoid the dangers that might arise from
mutual jealousies if they were drawn up in divisions apart.
Instead of giving the list of his fleet according to the
<i>ordre de bataille</i> drawn up in Cadiz harbour long before
the event, it will be more convenient to arrange the list as
they actually lay in line from van to rear on the day of
battle.</p>

<p>The following, then, is the list of the allied Franco-Spanish
fleet:</p>

<p>But here once more&mdash;as so often happens in naval war&mdash;the
mere reckoning up of ships and guns does not give the
true measure of fighting power. The British fleet was immeasurably
superior in real efficiency, and the French and
Spanish leaders knew this perfectly well.</p>

<p>The morning of 19 October was fine and clear with the
wind from the shore. So clear was the day that the lookout
in the foretop of the "Euryalus" could see the
ripples on the beach. As the sun rose the enemy's ships
were seen to be setting their topsails, and one by one they
unmoored and towed down towards the harbour mouth.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
It was a long process working the ships singly out of harbour.
Blackwood, of the "Euryalus," stood close in, and
from early morning till near 2 p.m. was sending his messages
to the distant fleet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hoisted 7.20 a.m. transmitted to the "Victory" soon
after 9 a.m.: "The enemy's ships are coming out."</p>

<p>11 a.m.: "Nineteen under sail. All the rest have top-yards
hoisted except Spanish rear-admiral and one line-of-battle
ship."</p>

<p>About 11.3: "Little wind in harbour. Two of the enemy
are at anchor."</p>

<p>Noon: "Notwithstanding little wind, enemy persevere
to get outward. The rest, except one line, ready, yards
hoisted."</p>

<p>Just before 2 p.m.: "Enemy persevering to work outward.
Seven of line already without and two frigates."</p></div>

<p>When the fleet began to show in force outside, Blackwood
drew off to a distance of four miles from the shore
and still watched them. He knew the "Euryalus" could
outsail the fastest of the enemy if they tried to attack him.
His business was to keep them under observation. He
could see that for want of wind they were forced to work
out ship after ship by towing them with rowing-boats. He
knew they could not be all out till the Sunday morning,
and he knew also that Nelson had acknowledged his messages
and was beating up nearer and nearer to the port,
though with the light winds he could only make slow progress.
Unless the enemy scuttled back into the harbour
a battle was inevitable.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning (20 October) the wind freshened
and enabled Villeneuve to bring out the last of his ships.
They were hardly out when the wind changed and blew
strong from the south-west, with squalls of rain. The
French admiral signalled the order to tack to the southward
under shortened sail. The fleet had been directed to
sail in five parallel divisions, each in line ahead, but for
want of training in the crews the ships lost station, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
formation was very irregular. At four in the afternoon
the wind changed again to the north-west, but it was very
light and the fleet moved slowly. To the westward all day
the "Euryalus" and "Sirius" frigates were seen watching
Villeneuve's progress, and just as darkness was closing
in one of the French frigates signalled that there were
twenty sail coming in from the Atlantic.</p>

<p>If there had been more wind, Villeneuve might have
crowded all sail for the Straits, but he could only creep
slowly along. Flashes and flares of light to seaward showed
him the British were exchanging night signals in the darkness.
He felt he was closely watched, and he was haunted
by the memory of the disastrous night battle in Aboukir
Bay. Though the wind had gone down the sea was rough,
with a heavy swell rolling in from the westward, the well-known
sign of an Atlantic storm that might break on the
Spanish coast before many hours. The flickering signals
of the British fleet seemed to come nearer as the darkness
of the moonless autumn night deepened, and about nine
a shadowy mass of sails was seen not far off. It was the
"Euryalus" that had closed in with every light shaded
to have a near look at the enemy.</p>

<p>There was an alarm that the British were about to
attack, and Villeneuve signalled to clear for action and
form the prescribed double line of battle. The sharp drumbeats
from the French ships, the lighting up of open ports,
the burning of blue lights, showed Blackwood what was
in progress. It was nearly two hours before the lines were
formed, and there was much confusion, ships slipping into
stations not assigned to them; and Gravina, who had been
directed to keep twelve of the best ships as an independent
reserve, or "squadron of observation," placing them in the
line instead of forming independently. Then the fleet went
about, reversing its order. Villeneuve had given up the
idea of reaching the Straits without a battle, and was
anxious to have the port of Cadiz under his lee when the
crisis came.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>Nelson's fleet, in two columns in line ahead, was drawing
nearer and nearer to his enemy. Between the two fleets
the "Euryalus" flitted like a ghost, observing and reporting
every move of the allies, and sometimes coming quite
near them. When the enemy reversed their order of sailing,
Blackwood's ship was for a short time ahead of their
double line, and saw the allied fleet looking like "a lighted
street some six miles long."</p>

<p>After midnight the alarm in the Franco-Spanish fleet
had passed off, and all the men who could be spared had
turned in. At dawn on the Monday the French frigate
"Hermione" reported the enemy in sight to windward,
and at seven Villeneuve again gave the order to clear for
action.</p>

<p>The sight of the allied fleet had called forth a great
outburst of exultation on board of Nelson's ships. "As
the day dawned," wrote one of his officers, "the horizon
appeared covered with ships. The whole force of the enemy
was discovered standing to the southward, distant about
nine miles, between us and the coast near Trafalgar. I was
awakened by the cheers of the crew and by their rushing
up the hatchways to get a glimpse of the hostile fleet. The
delight they manifested exceeded anything I ever witnessed."</p>

<p>Opposing fleets separated by only nine miles of sea would
in our day be exchanging long-range fire after a very few
minutes of rapid approach. It was to be nearly six hours
before Nelson and Villeneuve came within fighting distance.
The wind had become so slight that the British
fleet was often moving at a speed of barely more than a
knot over the grey-green ocean swells.</p>

<p>Still anxious to fight, with Cadiz as a refuge for disabled
ships, Villeneuve presently signalled to his fleet to go about.
After they altered their order of sailing and began to sail
to the northward, moving very slowly with the wind abeam
(close-hauled on the port tack), the course of the "Victory"
was a little north of east, directed at first to a point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
about two and a half miles ahead of the leading ship of the
enemy. The "Royal Sovereign," leading the leeward
line on a parallel course, was about a mile to the southward.
As the allied fleet was moving so as presently to
cross the course of the British, the result would be that at
the moment of contact the line led by the "Victory"
would come in a little ahead of the enemy's centre, and the
"Royal Sovereign" to the rearward of it. But the courses
of the two fleets did not intersect at right angles. Many
of the current plans of the battle, and, strange to say, the
great model at the Royal United Service Institution
(though constructed while many Trafalgar captains were
still living), are misleading in representing the British advance
as a perpendicular attack in closely formed line ahead.</p>

<p>In the heavy swell and the light wind the allied fleet had
succeeded in forming only an irregular line when it went
about. There were wide gaps, some of them covered by ships
lying in a second line; and the fleet was not in a straight
line from van to rear, but the van formed an obtuse angle
with the rearward ships, the flat apex towards Cadiz, so
that some of Nelson's officers thought the enemy had
adopted a crescent-formed array. At the moment of contact
Collingwood's division was advancing on a course
that formed an acute angle of between forty and fifty
degrees with the line and course of the French rear. The
result would be that the ships that followed the "Royal
Sovereign" were brought opposite ship after ship of the
French line and could fall upon them almost simultaneously
by a slight alteration of the course. But the French
van line lay at a greater angle to the windward attack,
and here the British advance was much nearer the perpendicular.</p>

<p>Nelson had in his memorandum forbidden any time being
wasted in forming a regular battle-line. The ships were to
attack in the order and formation in which they sailed.
If the enemy was to leeward (as was the case now), the
leeward line, led by Collingwood, was to fall upon his rearward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
ships. Meanwhile, the windward line, led by the
"Victory," would cut through the enemy just in advance
of the centre, and take care that the attack on the rear
was not interfered with. Collingwood was given a free
hand as to how he did his work. Nelson reminded the
captains that in the smoke and confusion of battle set
plans were likely to go to pieces, and signals to be unseen,
and he left a wide discretion to every one, noting that no
captain could do wrong if he laid his ship alongside of the
nearest of the enemy. The actual battle was very unlike
the diagram in the memorandum, which showed the
British fleet steering a course parallel to the enemy up to
the actual attack, and some of the captains thought that
in the confusion of the fight Nelson and Collingwood had
abandoned the plan. But if its letter was not realized, its
spirit was acted upon. Nelson had said he intended to
produce a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, a close fight in which the better training
and the more rapid and steady fire of the British would
tell. It was a novelty that the two admirals each led a line
into the fight. The traditional position for a flagship was
in the middle of the admiral's division, with a frigate near
her to assist in showing and passing signals along the line.
To the French officers it seemed a piece of daring rashness
for the flagships to lead the lines, exposing themselves as
they closed to the concentrated fire of several ships.
"This method of engaging battle," wrote Gicquel des
Touches, an officer of the "Intr&eacute;pide," "was contrary to
ordinary prudence, for the British ships, reaching us one
by one, and at a very slow speed, seemed bound to be
overpowered in detail by our superior forces; but Nelson
knew his own fleet&mdash;and ours." This was, indeed, the
secret of it all. He knew the distant fire of the enemy
would be all but harmless, and once broadside to broadside,
he could depend on crushing his opponents.</p>

<p>This was why he did not trouble about forming a closely
arrayed battle-line, but let his ships each make her best
speed, disregarding the mere keeping of station and distance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
so that though we speak of two lines, Collingwood's
ships trailed out over miles of sea, and Nelson's seemed to
the French to come on in an irregular crowd, the "Victory"
in the leading place, having her two nearest consorts not
far astern, but one on each quarter, and at times nearly
abreast. Every stitch of canvas was spread, the narrow
yards being lengthened out with the booms for the studding-sails.
Blackwood had been called on board the
"Victory" for a while during the advance. Nelson asked
him to witness his will, and then talked to him of the
coming victory, saying he would not be satisfied with less
than twenty prizes. He was cheerful and talked freely,
but all the while he carefully watched the enemy's course
and formation, and personally directed the course of his
own ship. He meant, as he had said before, to keep the
enemy uncertain to the last as to his attack, and as the
distance shortened he headed for a while for the enemy's
van before turning for the dash into his centre. Cheerful
as he was, he did not expect to survive the fight. He disregarded
the request of his friends to give the dangerous
post at the head of the line to another ship, and though
it was known that the enemy had soldiers on board, and
there would be a heavy musketry fire at close quarters, he
wore on his admiral's uniform a glittering array of stars
and orders.</p>

<p>To the advancing fleet the five miles of the enemy's line
presented a formidable spectacle. We have the impressions
of one of the midshipmen of the "Neptune" in a letter
written after the battle, and he tells how&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was a beautiful sight when their line was completed,
their broadsides turned towards us, showing their iron teeth,
and now and then trying the range of a shot to ascertain
the distance, that they might, the moment we came within
point-blank (about 600 yards), open their fire upon our van
ships&mdash;no doubt with the hope of dismasting some of our
leading vessels before they could close and break their line.
Some of the enemy's ships were painted like ourselves with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
double yellow streaks, some with a broad single red or yellow
streak, others all black, and the noble Santissima Trinidad
with four distinct lines of red, with a white ribbon between
them, made her seem to be a superb man-of-war, which,
indeed, she was."</p></div>

<p>The Spanish flagship was the largest ship afloat at the
time, and she towered high above her consorts. It was not
the first time Nelson had seen her in battle, for she was in
the fleet that he and Jervis defeated twelve years before
off Cape St. Vincent.</p>

<p>As the fleets closed the famous signal, "<i>England expects
that every man will do his duty!</i>" flew from the "Victory."
At half-past eleven the "Royal Sovereign," leading the lee
line, was within a thousand yards of the enemy, making
for a point a little to rearward of his centre, when the
"Fougueux," the ship for which she was heading, fired a
first trial shot. Other ships opened fire in succession, and
the centre began firing at the "Victory" and her consorts.
Not a shot in reply was fired by the British till they were
almost upon the allies. In the windward line the
"Victory," already under fire from eight ships of the allied
van, began the battle by firing her forward guns on the
port side as she turned to attack the French admiral's flagship,
the 100-gun "Bucentaure."</p>

<p>Just as the "Victory" opened fire, at ten minutes to
twelve, Collingwood, in the "Royal Sovereign," had
dashed into the allied line. He passed between the French
"Fougueux" and the "Santa Ana," the flagship of the
Spanish Rear-Admiral Alava, sending one broadside
crashing into the stern of the flagship, and with the other
raking the bows of the Frenchman. "What would not
Nelson give to be here!" said Collingwood to his flag-captain.
The hearty comradeship of the two admirals is
shown by the fact that at that moment Nelson, pointing
to the "Royal Sovereign's" masts towering out of the
dense smoke-cloud, exclaimed, "See how that noble fellow,
Collingwood, takes his ship into action!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>Swinging round on the inside of the "Santa Ana,"
Collingwood engaged her muzzle to muzzle. For a few
minutes of fierce fighting he was alone in the midst of a
ring of close fire, the "Fougueux" raking him astern, and
two Spanish and one French ship firing into his starboard
side. The pressure on him decreased as the other ships of
his division, coming rapidly into action, closed with ship
after ship of the allied rear. Further relief was afforded by
Nelson's impetuous attack on the centre.</p>

<p>He was steering the "Victory" to pass astern of the
"Bucentaure." Captain Lucas, of the "Redoutable,"
the next in the line, saw this, and resolved to protect his
admiral. He closed up so that his bowsprit was almost
over the flagship's stern, and the "Bucentaure's" people
called out to him not to run into them. The "Victory"
then passed astern of the "Redoutable," raking her with
a terribly destructive broadside, and then ranged up alongside
of her. Lucas had hoped to board the first ship he encountered.
He grappled the English flagship, and while
the soldiers in the French tops kept up a hot fire on the
upper decks, the broadside guns were blazing muzzle to
muzzle below, and a crowd of boarders made gallant but
unsuccessful attempts to cross the gap between the two
ships, the plucky Frenchmen being everywhere beaten
back. The "Redoutable's" way had been checked, and
through the gap between her and the "Bucentaure"
came the "Neptune" to engage the French flagship, while
the famous "fighting 'T&eacute;m&eacute;raire,'" which had raced the
"Victory" into action, passed astern of the "Redoutable"
and closed with the Spanish "San Justo." Ship after ship
of both the British divisions came up, though there were
long gaps in the lines. The "Belleisle," second of Collingwood's
line, was three-quarters of a mile astern of the
"Royal Sovereign" when the first shots were fired. It was
nearly two hours before the rearmost English ships were
engaged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the leading eight ships of the French van,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
commanded by Admiral Dumanoir, in the "Formidable,"
after firing at the "Victory" and her immediate consorts,
as they came into action, had held on their course, and
were steadily drifting away from the battle. In vain
Villeneuve signalled to them to engage the enemy. Dumanoir,
in a lame explanation that he afterwards wrote,
protested that he had no enemy within his reach, and that
with the light wind he found it impossible to work back,
though he used boats to tow his ships round. The effort
appears to have been made only when he had gone so far
that he was a mere helpless spectator of the fight, and his
most severe condemnation lies in the fact that without his
orders two of his captains eventually made their way back
into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and, though it was too late to fight for victory,
fought a desperate fight for the honour of the flag they flew.</p>

<p>Dumanoir's incompetent selfishness left the centre and
rear to be crushed by equal numbers and far superior
fighting power. But it was no easy victory. Outmatched
as they were, Frenchmen and Spaniards fought with
desperate courage and heroic determination. Trafalgar is
remembered with pride by all the three nations whose
flags flew over its cloud of battle-smoke.</p>

<p>There is no naval battle regarding which we possess so
many detailed narratives of those who took part in it on
both sides, and it would be easy to compile a long list of
stirring incidents and heroic deeds. Though the battle
lasted till about five o'clock, it had been practically decided
in the first hour. In that space of time many of the
enemy's ships had been disabled, two had been actually
taken; and, on the other hand, England had suffered a
loss that dimmed the brightness of the victory.</p>

<p>In the first stage of the fight Nelson's flagship was engaged
with the "Redoutable" alone, the two ships locked
together. Presently the "T&eacute;m&eacute;raire" closed on the other
side of the Frenchman, and the "Victory" found herself
in action with a couple of the enemy that came drifting
through the smoke on the other side of her, one of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
being the giant "Santisima Trinidad." Before the
"T&eacute;m&eacute;raire" engaged her, the "Redoutable" had been
fearfully damaged by the steady fire of the "Victory," and
had also lost heavily in repeated attempts to board the
English flagship. Only a midshipman and four men
succeeded in scrambling on board, and they were at once
killed or made prisoners. Captain Lucas, of the "Redoutable,"
in the report on the loss of his ship, told how out
of a crew of 643 officers and men, sailors and soldiers, three
hundred were killed, and more than two hundred badly
wounded, including most of the officers; the ship was dismasted,
stern-post damaged, and steering gear destroyed,
and the stern on fire; she was leaking badly, and most of
the pumps had been shot through; most of the lower-deck
guns were dismounted, some by collision with the enemy's
sides, some by his fire, and two guns had burst. Both sides
of the ship were riddled, in several places two or more
ports had been knocked into one, and the after-deck beams
had come down, making a huge gap in the upper-deck.
The "Redoutable," already in a desperate condition,
became a sinking wreck when the "T&eacute;m&eacute;raire" added her
fire to that of the flagship.</p>

<p>But the "Victory" had not inflicted this loss herself unscathed.
One of her masts had gone over the side, and
there had been heavy loss on her upper decks and in her
batteries. The wheel was shot away. Several men had
been killed and wounded on the quarter-deck, where Nelson
was walking up and down talking to Captain Hardy. One
shot strewed the deck with the bodies of eight marines.
Another smashed through a boat, and passed between
Nelson and Hardy, bruising the latter's foot, and taking
away a shoe-buckle. All the while there came a crackle of
musketry from a party of sharpshooters in the mizen-top
of the "Redoutable," only some sixty feet away, and
Nelson's decorations must have made him a tempting
target, even if the marksmen did not know who he was.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes past one he was hit in the left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
shoulder, the bullet plunging downwards and backwards
into his body. He fell on his face, and Hardy, turning, saw
some of the men picking him up. "They have done for me
at last, Hardy," he said. "I hope not," said the captain.
And Nelson replied: "Yes, my backbone is shot through."
But he showed no agitation, and as the men carried him
below he covered his decorations with a handkerchief, lest
the crew should notice them and realize that they had lost
their chief, and he gave Hardy an order to see that tiller-lines
were rigged on the rudder-head, to replace the
shattered wheel.</p>

<p>His flag was kept flying, and till the action ended the
fleet was not aware of his loss, and looked to the "Victory"
for signals as far as the smoke allowed. He had not been
ten minutes among the wounded on the lowest deck when
the cheers of the crew, following on a sudden lull in the
firing, told him that the "Redoutable" had struck her
colours.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the "Fougueux," the second prize
of the day, was secured. She had come into action with
the "T&eacute;m&eacute;raire" while the latter was still engaged with
the "Redoutable." On the surrender of the latter the
"T&eacute;m&eacute;raire" was able to concentrate her fire on the
"Fougueux." Mast after mast came down, and the sea was
pouring into two huge holes on the water-line when the
shattered ship drifted foul of the "T&eacute;m&eacute;raire," and was
grappled by her. Lieutenant Kennedy dashed on board
of the Frenchman, at the head of a rush of boarders, cleared
her upper decks, hauled down her flag, and took possession
of the dismasted ship.</p>

<p>Between two and three o'clock no less than nine ships
were taken, five Spanish and four French. Villeneuve's
flagship, the "Bucentaure," was one of these. She struck
a few minutes after two o'clock. At the opening of the
battle she had fired four broadsides at the approaching
"Victory." Nelson gave her one shattering broadside in
reply at close quarters, as he passed on to attack the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
"Redoutable." As this ship's way was stopped, and a
space opened between her and the French flagship, Captain
Fremantle brought his three-decker, the "Neptune,"
under the "Bucentaure's" stern, raking her as he passed
through the line and ranged up beside her. Then Pellew
brought the "Conqueror" into action beside her on the
other side, and as chance allowed her guns to bear the
"Victory" was at times able to join in the attack. French
accounts of the battle tell of the terrible destruction caused
on board the "Bucentaure" by this concentrated fire.
More than two hundred were <i>hors de combat</i>, most of them
killed. Almost every officer and man on the quarter-deck
was hit, Villeneuve himself being slightly wounded. The
men could hardly stand to the guns, and at last their fire
was masked by mast after mast coming down with yards,
rigging and sails hanging over the gun muzzles. Villeneuve
declared his intention of transferring his flag to another
ship, but was told that every boat had been knocked to
splinters, and his attendant frigate, which might have
helped him in this emergency, had been driven out of the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. As the last of the masts went over the side at two
o'clock, the "Conqueror" ceased firing, and hailed the
"Bucentaure" with a summons to surrender. Five
minutes later her flag, hoisted on an improvised staff, was
taken down, and Captain Atcherley, of the "Conqueror's"
marines, went on board the French flagship, and received
the surrender of Admiral Villeneuve, his staff-officer Captain
Prigny, Captain Magendie, commanding the ship, and
General de Contamine, the officer in command of the 4000
French troops embarked on the fleet.</p>

<p>Next in the line ahead of the "Bucentaure" lay the
giant "Santisima Trinidad," carrying the flag of Rear-Admiral
Cisneros. As the fleets closed, she had exchanged
fire with her four tiers of guns with several of the British
ships. When the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e began she came drifting down into
the thick of the fight. For a while she was engaged with
the "Victory" in the dense fog of smoke, where so many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
ships were tearing each other to pieces in the centre. The
high-placed guns of the "Trinidad's" upper tier cut up
the "Victory's" rigging and sent down one of her masts.
The English flagship was delivered from the attack of her
powerful antagonist by the "Trinidad" drifting clear of
her. By this time Fremantle was attacking her with the
"Neptune," supported by the "Colossus." At half-past
one a third ship joined in the close attack on the towering
"Trinidad," which every captain who got anywhere near
her was anxious to make his prize. This new ally was the
battleship "Africa." During the night she had run out to
the northward of the British fleet. Nelson had signalled to
her early in the day to rejoin as soon as possible, but her
captain, Digby, needed no pressing. He was crowding sail
to join in the battle. He ran down past Dumanoir's ships
of the van squadron, putting a good many shots into them,
but receiving no damage from their ill-aimed fire. Then
he steered into the thick of the fight, taking for his guide
the tall masts of the "Trinidad." At 1.30 he opened
fire on her. At 1.58 all the masts of the "Trinidad"
came down together, the enormous mass of spars, rigging,
and sails going over her side into the water as she rolled
to the swell. She had already lost some four hundred
men killed and wounded (Admiral Cisneros was among
the latter). Many of her guns had been silenced, and
the fall of the masts masked a whole broadside. She now
ceased firing and surrendered. In the log of the "Africa"
it is noted that Lieutenant Smith was sent with a party to
take possession of her. He does not seem to have succeeded
in getting on board, for the "Trinidad" drifted with
silent guns for at least two hours after, with no prize crew
on board. It was at the end of the battle that the "Prince"
sent a party to board her and took her in tow.</p>

<p>Another flagship, the three-decker "Santa Ana,"
carrying the flag of Rear-Admiral Alava, became the prize
of the "Royal Sovereign." Collingwood had opened the
fight by breaking the line astern of her. His raking broadside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
as he swept past her had put scores of her crew out
of action. When he laid his ship alongside of her to leeward,
it was evident from the very first that she could not
meet the English ship on anything like equal terms. In a
quarter of an hour his flag-captain, Rotherham, grasped
Collingwood's hand, saying: "I congratulate you, sir.
Her fire is slackening, and she must soon strike." But
the "Santa Ana" fought to the last, till only a single
gun, now here, now there, answered the steady, pounding
fire of the "Royal Sovereign's" broadside. At 2.30
her colours came down. Collingwood told his lieutenant
to send the Spanish admiral on board his own ship, but
word was sent back that Alava was too badly wounded to
be moved. More than four hundred of the "Santa Ana's"
crew had been killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The "Tonnant," third ship in Collingwood's line, and
one of the prizes taken in the Battle of the Nile, captured
another flagship, that of the gallant Rear-Admiral Magon,
the "Alg&eacute;ciras." As the "Tonnant" went through the allied
line, after exchanging fire with the "Fougueux" and the
"Monarca," the "Alg&eacute;ciras" raked her astern, killing
some forty men. The "Tonnant" then swung round
and engaged the "Alg&eacute;ciras," and was crossing her bows
when Magon, trying to run his ship alongside her, to board,
entangled his bowsprit in the main rigging of the English
ship. She was thus held fast with only a few forward guns
bearing, while most of the broadside of the "Tonnant"
was raking her. From the foretop of the "Alg&eacute;ciras"
a party of marksmen fired down on the English decks
and wounded Captain Tyler badly. Admiral Magon, in
person, tried to lead a strong body of boarders over his
bows into the English ship. Mortally wounded, he was
carried aft, and of his men only one set foot on the "Tonnant."
This man was at once stabbed with a pike, and
would have been killed if an officer had not rescued him.</p>

<p>The ships lay so close that the flashes of the "Tonnant's"
guns set fire to the bows of the "Alg&eacute;ciras," and the flames
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
spread to both ships. A couple of British sailors dragged
the fire-hose over the hammock-nettings, and while the
guns were still in action they worked to keep down and
extinguish the flames. One by one the masts of the
"Alg&eacute;ciras" went into the sea, carrying the unfortunate
soldiers in the tops with them. In a little more than half
an hour she lost 436 men, including most of her officers.
Her position was hopeless, and at last she struck her
colours. The prize crew that boarded her found Magon
lying dead on the deck, with his captain, badly wounded,
beside him.</p>

<p>The "Bellerophon" (famous for her fight at the Nile,
adding to her record of hard fighting to-day, and destined
to be the ship that was to receive the conqueror of Europe
as a prisoner) followed the "Tonnant" into action, and
found herself engaged with the Spanish "Monarca" on
one side, and the French "Aigle" on the other. She came
in collision with the "Aigle," and their yards locked together.
The "Bellerophon's" rigging was cut to pieces;
two of her masts were carried away, and numbers of her
crew were struck down, her captain being wounded early
in the day. A little after half-past one the "Aigle"
drifted clear, and was engaged by, and in half an hour
forced to strike to, the "Defiance." Meanwhile the
"Bellerophon" was hard at work with two Spanish ships,
the "Monarca" and the "Bahama," and so effectually
battered them that at three o'clock the former was a
prize, and the other surrendered half an hour later.</p>

<p>The "Tonnant," after her capture of Magon's ship,
shared in the victory over another brave opponent, Commodore
Churucca, and his ship, the "San Juan Nepomuceno."
Churucca was the youngest flag-officer in the
Spanish navy. He had won a European reputation by
explorations in the Pacific and on the South American
coasts. Keen in his profession, recklessly courageous,
deeply religious, he was an ideal hero of the Spanish navy,
in which he is still remembered as "El Gran Churucca,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the "great Churucca," who "died like the Cid." He had
no illusions, but told his friends he was going to defeat
and death, and he knew that when he left Cadiz he was
bidding a last farewell to the young wife he had lately
married.</p>

<p>"The French admiral does not know his business," he
said to his first lieutenant, as he watched the van division
holding its course, while the two English lines rushed to
the attack. As the English closed with the Spanish rear,
Churucca's ship came into close action with the "Defiance,"
and was then attacked in succession by the
"Dreadnought" and the "Tonnant." The "San Juan"
fought till half her men were <i>hors de combat</i>, several guns
dismounted, and two of the masts down. As long as
Churucca lived the unequal fight was maintained. For a
while he seemed to have a charmed life, as he passed from
point to point, encouraging his men. He was returning
to his quarter-deck, when a ball shattered one of his legs.
"It is nothing&mdash;keep on firing," he said, and at first he
refused to leave the deck, lying on the planking, with the
shattered limb roughly bandaged. He sent for his second
in command, and was told he had just been killed. Another
officer, though wounded, took over the active command
when at last Churucca, nearly dead from loss of blood, was
carried below. He gave a last message for his wife, sent
a final order that the ship should be fought till she sank,
and then said he must think only of God and the other
world. As he expired the "San Juan" gave up the hopeless
fight. The three ships all claimed her as their prize,
but it was the "Dreadnought" that took possession.</p>

<p>The French "Swiftsure," once English, was won back
by the "Colossus," after a fight in which the "Orion"
helped for a while. With her capture one-third of the
enemy's whole force, including several flagships, was in
English hands. The victory was won; it was now only a
question of making it more and more complete.</p>

<p>Shortly after three o'clock the Spanish 80-gun ship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"Argonauta" struck to the "Belleisle," which had been
aided in her attack by the English "Swiftsure." A few
minutes later the "Leviathan" took another big Spaniard,
the "San Agustino," carrying her with a rush of boarders.
It was about four o'clock that, after an hour of hard fighting,
the "San Ildefonso" hauled down her colours to the
"Defence." About this time the French "Achille" was
seen to be ablaze and ceased firing. In the earlier stages
of the fight she had been engaged successively with the
"Polyphemus," "Defiance," and "Swiftsure." Her
captain and several of her officers and nearly 400 men
had been killed and wounded when she was brought to
close action by the "Prince." Her fore-rigging caught
fire, and the mast coming down across the decks started
a blaze in several places, and the men, driven from the
upper deck by the English fire, had to abandon their
attempts to save their ship. She was well alight when at
last she struck her colours, and the "Prince," aided by
the little brig "Pickle," set to work to save the survivors
of her crew. She blew up after the battle. The "Berwick"
was another ship taken before four o'clock, but I
cannot trace the details of her capture.</p>

<p>While the battle still raged fiercely, Admiral Dumanoir,
in the "Formidable," was steering away to the north-westward,
followed by the "Mont Blanc," "Duguay-Trouin,"
and "Scipion." But two ships of his division,
the "Neptuno" and the "Intr&eacute;pide," had disregarded his
orders, and turned back to join in the fight, working the
ships' heads round by towing them with boats. The
"Intr&eacute;pide" led. Her captain, Infernet, was a rough
Proven&ccedil;al sailor, who had fought his way from the forecastle
to the quarter-deck. Indignant at Dumanoir's
conduct, he had early in the battle given orders to steer
for the thickest of it. "<i>Lou capo sur lou 'Bucentaure'!</i>"
("Head her for the 'Bucentaure'!") he shouted in his
native patois. He arrived too late to fight for victory,
but he fought for the honour of his flag. After engaging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
several British ships, Infernet struck to the "Orion." An
officer of the "Conqueror" (which had taken part in the
fight with the "Intr&eacute;pide") wrote: "Her captain surrendered
after one of the most gallant defences I ever
witnessed. His name was Infernet, and it deserves to be
recorded by all who admire true heroism. The 'Intr&eacute;pide'
was the last ship that struck her colours." The
Spanish ship that had followed the "Intr&eacute;pide" into
action, the 80-gun "Neptuno," had shortly before been
forced to strike to the "Minotaur" and the "Spartiate,"
another of the prizes of Aboukir Bay.</p>

<p>Before these last two surrenders completed the long list
of captured ships, Nelson had passed away. The story of
his death in the cockpit of the "Victory" is too well
known to need repetition. Before he died the cheers of
his crew and the messages brought to him had told him
of capture after capture, and assured him that his triumph
was complete. As the firing ceased, Collingwood took
over the command of the fleet, and transferred his flag
from his own shattered and dismasted ship, the "Royal
Sovereign," to Blackwood's smart frigate, the "Euryalus."</p>

<p>When the "Intr&eacute;pide" struck, seventeen ships of the
allied fleet had been taken, one, the "Achille," was in a
blaze, and soon to blow up; four were in flight far away
to the north-west, eleven were making for Cadiz, all bearing
the marks of hard hitting during the fight. Some desultory
firing at the nearest fugitives ended the battle. Crowds on
the breakwater of Cadiz and the nearest beaches had
watched all the afternoon the great bank of smoke on the
horizon, and listened to the rumbling thunder of the
cannonade. After sunset ship after ship came in, bringing
news of disaster, and all the night wounded men were
being conveyed to the hospitals.</p>

<p>More than half the allied fleet had been taken or destroyed.
The four ships that escaped with Dumanoir were
captured a few days later by a squadron under Sir Richard
Strachan. The French ships that escaped into Cadiz were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
taken possession of by the Spanish insurgents, when
Spain rose against the French, and Cadiz joined the revolt.</p>

<p>As the battle ended, the British fleet was, to use the
expression of the "Neptune's" log, "in all directions."
The sun was going down; the sky was overcast, and the
rising swell and increasing wind told of the coming storm.
Most of the prizes had been dismasted; many of them
were leaking badly; some of the ships that had taken
them were in almost as damaged a condition, and many of
them were short-handed, with heavy losses in battle and
detachments sent on board the captured vessels. The
crews were busy clearing the decks, getting up improvised
jury masts, and repairing the badly cut-up rigging, where
the masts still stood. Nelson's final order had been to
anchor to ride out the expected gale. Collingwood doubted
if this would be safer than trying to make Gibraltar, and
he busied himself getting the scattered fleet and prizes
together, and tacking to the south-westward.</p>

<p>The gale that swept all the coasts of Western Europe
caught the disabled fleet with the hostile shore under its
lee. Only four of the prizes, and those the poorest ships
of the lot, ever saw Gibraltar. Ship after ship went down,
others were abandoned and burnt, others drove ashore.
In these last instances the British prize crews were rescued
and kindly treated by the Spanish coast population. One
ship, the "Alg&eacute;ciras," was retaken by the French prisoners,
and carried into Cadiz. Another, the big "Santa Ana,"
was recaptured as she drifted helplessly off the port.</p>

<p>But though there were few trophies left after the great
storm, Trafalgar had finally broken the naval power of
Napoleon, freed England from all fear of invasion, and
given her the undisputed empire of the sea. Yet there
were only half-hearted rejoicings at home. The loss of
Nelson seemed a dear price to pay even for such a victory.</p>

<p>Some 2500 men were killed and wounded in the victorious
fleet. Of the losses of the Allies it is difficult to give an
estimate. Every ship that was closely engaged suffered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
severely, and hundreds of wounded went down in several
of those that sank in the storm. For weeks after search-parties,
riding along the shores from Cadiz to Cape Trafalgar
gathered every day a grim harvest of corpses drifted to land
by the Atlantic tides. The allied loss was at least 7000
men, and may have been considerably greater.</p>

<p>The news came to England, just after something like a
panic had been caused by the tidings of the surrender of a
whole Austrian army at Ulm. It reached Napoleon in the
midst of his triumphs, to warn him that his power was
bounded by the seas that washed the shores of the Continent.
Well did Meredith say that in his last great fight
Nelson "drove the smoke of Trafalgar to darken the blaze
of Austerlitz."</p>

<p class="title big">
THE COMING OF STEAM AND ARMOURED NAVIES
</p>

<p class="title">
THE FIGHT IN HAMPTON ROADS<br />
<span class="smcap">March</span>, 1862</p>


<p>Trafalgar was the greatest fight of the sailing-ships.
There were later engagements which were
fought under sail, but no battle of such decisive import.
It was a fitting close to a heroic era in the history of naval
war, a period of not much more than four centuries, in
thousands of years. Before it, came the long ages in which
the fighting-ship depended more upon the oar than the
sail, or on the oar exclusively. After it, came our present
epoch of machine-propelled warships, bringing with it
wide-sweeping changes in construction, armament, and
naval tactics.</p>

<p>Inventive pioneers were busy with projects for the
coming revolution in naval war while Nelson was still
living. The Irish-American engineer, Fulton, had tried to
persuade Napoleon to adopt steam propulsion, and had
astonished the Parisians by showing them his little steamer
making its way up the Seine with clumsy paddles churning
up the waters and much sooty smoke pouring from its
tall, thin funnel. The Emperor thought it was a scientific
toy. Old admirals&mdash;most conservative of men&mdash;declared
that a gunboat with a few long "sweeps" or oars would
be a handier fighting-ship in a calm, and if there was any
wind a spread of sail was better than all the American's
tea-kettle devices. Fulton went back to America to run
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
passenger steamers on the Hudson, and tell unbelieving
commodores and captains that the future of the sea power
lay with the "tea-kettle ships."</p>

<p>In the days of the long peace that followed Waterloo, and
the great industrial development that came with it, the
steam-engine and the paddle-steamer made their way into
the commercial fleets of the world, slowly and timidly at
first, for it was a long time before a steamship could be provided
with enough efficient engine power to enable her to
show the way to a smart clipper-built sailing-ship, and the
early marine engines were fearfully uneconomical. Steam
had obtained a recognized position in small ships for short
voyages, ferry-boats, river steamers, and coasting craft,
but on the open ocean the sailing-ship still held its own.
An eminent scientist proved to demonstration that no
steamship would ever be able to cross the Atlantic under
steam alone. He showed that to do so it would be necessary
for her to carry a quantity of coal exceeding her entire
tonnage capacity, and he expressed his readiness to eat
the first steamer that made the voyage from Liverpool to
New York. But he lived to regret his offer.</p>

<p>In 1838 the "Great Western" and the "Sirius" inaugurated
the steam passenger service across the Atlantic,
and the days of the liner began. By this time paddle-wheel
gunboats were finding their way into the British
navy, and other powers were beginning to follow the
example of England. Steamships were first in action in
1840, when Sir Charles Napier employed them side by side
with sailing-ships that had shared the triumphs of Nelson.
This was in the attack on Acre, when England intervened
to check the revolt of the Pasha of Egypt, Ibrahim,
against his suzerain, the Sultan.</p>

<p>But still the steamship was regarded as an auxiliary.
The great three-decker battleships, the smart sailing
frigates, were the main strength of navies. The paddle-steamer
was a defective type of warship, because her
paddle-boxes and paddle-wheels, and her high-placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
engines, presented a huge target singularly vulnerable.
A couple of shots might disable in a minute her means of
propulsion. True she had masts and sails, but if she could
not use her engines, the paddles would prove a drag upon
all her movements.</p>

<p>It was the invention of the screw-propeller that made
steam propulsion for warships really practical. Brunel
was one of the great advocates of the change. He was a
man who was in many ways before his time, and he had
to encounter a more than usual amount of official conservatist
obstruction. For years the veteran officers who
advised the Admiralty opposed and ridiculed the invention.
When at last it was fitted to a gunboat, the "Rattler," it
was obvious that it provided the best means of applying
steam propulsion to the purposes of naval war. The propeller
was safe under water, and the engines could be
placed low down in the ship.</p>

<p>By 1854, when the Crimean War began, both the British
and French navies possessed a number of steam-propelled
line-of-battle ships, frigates, and gunboats, fitted with
the screw. They had also some old paddle-ships. But in
the fleets dispatched to the Baltic and the Black Sea
there were still a considerable number of sailing-ships,
and a fleet still did most of its work under sail. Even the
steamships had only what we should now describe as
auxiliary engines. The most powerful line-of-battle ships
in the British navy had engines of only 400 to 600 horsepower.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
With such relatively small power they still had
to depend chiefly on their sails. Tug-boats were attached
to the fleets to tow the sailing-ships, when the steamships
were using their engines.</p>

<p>Another change was taking place in the armament of
warships and coast defences. The rifled cannon was still
in the experimental stage, but explosive shells, which in
Nelson's days were only fired from mortars at very short
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
range, had now been adapted to guns mounted on the
broadside and the coast battery. Solid shot were still
largely used, but the coming of the shell meant that there
would be terrible loss in action in the crowded gun-decks,
and inventors were already proposing that ships should be
armoured to keep these destructive missiles from penetrating
their sides.</p>

<p>The attack on the sea front of Sebastopol by the allied
fleets on 17 October, 1854, was the event that brought
home to the minds of even the most conservative the
necessity of a great change in warship construction. It
rang the knell of the old wooden walls, and led to the introduction
of armour-clad navies.</p>

<p>The idea of protecting ships from the fire of artillery
and musketry by iron plating was an old one, and the
wonder is that it did not much earlier receive practical
application. The Dutch claim to have been the pioneers
of ironclad building more than three hundred years ago.
During the famous siege of Antwerp by the Spaniards in
1585 the people of the city built a huge flat-bottomed
warship, armoured with heavy iron plates, which they
named the "Finis Belli," a boastful expression of the
hope that she would end the war. An old print of the
"Finis Belli" shows a four-masted ship with a high poop
and forecastle, but with a low freeboard amidships. On
this lower deck, taking up half the length of the ship,
is an armoured citadel, with port-holes for four heavy
guns on each side. The roof of the citadel has a high
bulwark, loopholed for musketry. On three of the
masts there are also crow's-nests or round tops for
musketeers.</p>

<p>Heavily weighted with her armour, the ship had a deep
draught of water, and probably steered badly. In descending
the Scheldt to attack the Spaniards she ran
aground in a hopeless position under their batteries, and
fell into the hands of the Spanish commander, the Duke
of Parma. He kept the "Finis Belli" "as a curiosity"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
till the end of the siege, and then had her dismantled. If
she had scored a success, armoured navies would no doubt
have made their appearance in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Between the days of the "Finis Belli" and the coming
of the first ironclads there were numerous projects of inventors.
In 1805 a Scotchman, named Gillespie, proposed
the mounting of guns and "ponderous mortars" in revolving
armoured turrets, both in fortifications on shore
and on floating batteries. Two years later Abraham
Bloodgood, of New York, designed a floating battery with
an armoured turret. During the war between England
and the United States in 1812 an American engineer, John
Steevens, who was a man in advance of his time, proposed
the construction of a steam-propelled warship, with a
ram-bow, and with her guns protected by shields. He
prepared a design, but failed to persuade the Navy Department
that it was practicable. His son, Robert L. Steevens,
improved the design, made experiments with guns, projectiles,
and armour plates, and at last in 1842 obtained a
vote of Congress for the building of the "Steevens battery,"
a low-freeboard ram, steam-propelled, and armed with
eight heavy guns mounted on her centre-line, on turntables
protected by armoured breastworks. The methods
of the American navy were very dilatory, professional
opinion was opposed to Steevens, whose project was regarded
as that of a "crank," and the ship was left unfinished
for years. She was still on the stocks when the
Civil War began. Then other types came into fashion, and
she was broken up on the ways.</p>

<p>The man who introduced the armour-clad ship into the
world's navies was the Emperor Napoleon&nbsp;III, the same
who introduced rifled field artillery into the armies of the
world. Like other great revolutions, this epoch-making
change in naval war began in a small way. What forced
the question upon the Emperor's attention was the failure
of the combined French and English fleets in the attack on
the sea-forts of Sebastopol on 17 October, 1854. The most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
powerful ships in both navies had engaged the sea-forts,
and suffered such loss and injury that it was obvious that
if the attack had been continued the results would have
been disastrous. Some means must be found of keeping
explosive shells out of a ship's gun-decks, if they were ever
to engage land batteries on anything like equal terms.
Under the Emperor's directions the French naval architects
designed four ships of a new type, which were rapidly constructed
in the Imperial dockyards. They were "floating
batteries," not intended to take part in fleet actions, but
only to be used against fortifications. Their broad beam,
heavy lines, rounded bows, and engines of only 225 horsepower,
condemned them to slow speed, just sufficient to
place them in firing position. They were armoured with
4-inch iron and armed with eighteen 50-pounder guns.
The port-holes had heavy iron ports, which were closed
while the guns were reloading.</p>

<p>Three of these floating batteries, the "D&eacute;vastation,"
"Lave," and "Tonnant," came into action against the
shore batteries at Kinburn on 17 October, 1855 (the anniversary
of the attack on the Sebastopol sea-forts). There
was some difficulty in getting into position, as they could
just crawl along, and steered abominably. But when they
opened fire at 800 yards at 9 a.m. they silenced and
wrecked the Russian batteries in eighty-five minutes,
themselves suffering only trifling damage, and not losing
a dozen men.</p>

<p>It was the first and last fight of the floating batteries.
But while in England men were still discussing the problem
of the sea-going ironclad, the French constructors were
solving it. They had to look not to parliamentary and
departmental committees, but to the initiative and support
of an intelligent autocrat. So events went quicker in
France. In 1858 the keels of the first three French sea-going
armour-clads were laid down at Toulon, and next
year the armoured frigate "Gloire," the first of European
ironclads, was launched, and every dockyard in France was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
busy constructing armour-clads or rebuilding and armouring
existing ships.</p>

<p>France had gained a start in the building of the
new type of warship. When the "Dreadnought"
was launched, it was said somewhat boastfully that
single-handed she could destroy the whole North Sea fleet
of Germany. It might be more truly said of the "Gloire"
that she could have met single-handed and destroyed the
British Channel or Mediterranean Fleet of the day. It
was the moment when tension with France over the
Orsini conspiracy had caused a widespread anticipation
of war between that country and England, and had
called the Volunteer force into existence to repel invasion.
But the true defence must be in the command of the sea,
and the first English ironclad, the old "Warrior," was
laid down at the Thames Ironworks. Work was begun
in June, 1859, and the ship was launched in December,
1860. She was modelled on the old steam frigates, for the
special types of modern battleships and armoured cruisers
were still in the future. She was built of iron, with unarmoured
ends and 4&nbsp;&frac14;-inch iron plating on a backing of
18 inches of teak over 200 feet amidships of her total length
of 380 feet. There was a race of ironclad building between
France and England, in which the latter won easily, and
it was only for a very short time that our sea supremacy
was endangered by the French Emperor's naval enterprise.
But when the English and French fleets entered the
Gulf of Mexico in 1861, our ships were all wooden walls,
while the French admiral's flag flew on the ironclad
"Normandie," the first armoured ship that ever crossed
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this fact, American writers are fond of
saying, and many Englishmen believe, that the introduction
of armoured navies was the outcome of the American Civil
War of the early 'sixties. All that is true is that the War of
Secession gave the world the spectacle of the first fight
between armour-clad ships, and the experiences of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
war greatly influenced the direction taken in the general
policy of designers of ironclad warships.</p>

<span class="smcap">h.m.s. warrior, the first british ironclad</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the close of the Crimean War a Swedish engineer
settled in the United States, John Ericsson, had sent
to the Emperor Napoleon a design for a small armoured
turret-ship of what was afterwards known as the Monitor
type. He wrote to the Emperor that he asked for no
reward or profit, for he was only anxious to help France
in her warfare with Russia, the hereditary foe of Sweden.
The war was drawing to a close, and for his future projects
the Emperor wanted large sea-going ships, not light-draught
vessels for work in the shallows of the Baltic. So
Ericsson received a complimentary letter of thanks and a
medal, and kept his design for later use. His opportunity
came in the first months of the Civil War.</p>

<p>In the fifty years between the war of 1812 and the outbreak
of the struggle between North and South, the
American navy had been greatly neglected. It was a
favourite theory in the United States that a navy could
be improvised, and that the great thing would be, in case
of war, to send out swarms of privateers to prey upon the
enemy's commerce. Very little money was spent on the
navy or the dockyards. On the navy list there were a
number of old ships, some of which had fought against
England in 1812. There were a number of small craft for
revenue purposes, a lot of sailing-ships, and a few fairly
modern steam frigates and smaller steam vessels depending
largely on sail-power, and known as "sloops-of-war"&mdash;really
small frigates.</p>

<p>While the dockyards of Europe had long been busy with
the construction of the new armoured navies, the United
States had not a single ironclad. Both parties to the quarrel
had to improvise up-to-date ships.</p>

<p>Sea power was destined to play a great part in the conflict.
As soon as the Washington Government realized that it was
going to be a serious and prolonged war, not an affair of a
few weeks, a general plan of operations was devised, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
which the essential feature was the isolation of the Southern
Confederacy. When the crisis came in 1861 the United
States had done little to open up and occupy the vast
territories between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi
Valley. The population of the States was chiefly to
be found between the Mississippi and the Atlantic, and in
that region lay the states of the Confederacy. They were
mainly agricultural communities, with hardly any factories.
For arms, munitions of war, and supplies of many kinds
they would have to depend on importation from beyond
their frontiers. It was therefore decided that while the
United States armies operated on the northern or land
frontier of the Confederacy, its sea frontiers on the Atlantic
and the Gulf of Mexico should be closely blockaded, and its
river frontier, the line of the Mississippi, should be seized
and held by a mixed naval and military force. For these
last operations troops on the banks and gunboats on the
river had to combine. It was said at the time, that on the
Mississippi army and navy were like the two blades of a
pair of shears, useless apart, but very effective when working
together.</p>

<p>Strange to say, it was not the industrial North, but the
agricultural South, that put the first ironclad into commission
as a weapon against the coast blockade. When the
Secessionist forces seized the Navy Yard at Norfolk, in
Virginia, a fine steam frigate, the "Merrimac" (built in
1855), was under repair there. The guard of the dockyard
set her on fire before surrendering, but the flames were
extinguished, and the "Merrimac," with her upper works
badly damaged, was in possession of the Southerners. A
Northern squadron of frigates and gunboats, steam and
sailing ships, anchored in Hampton Roads, the landlocked
sheet of water into which runs not only the Elizabeth River,
which gives access to Norfolk, but also the James River,
the waterway to Richmond, then the Confederate capital.
The northern shores of Hampton Roads were held by
Federal troops, the southern by the Confederates. Presently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
spies brought to Washington the news that the
"Rebels" were preparing a terrible new kind of warship
at Norfolk to destroy the squadron in Hampton Roads
and raise the blockade.</p>

<p>The news was true. The Confederates had cut down the
"Merrimac" nearly to the water's edge and built a solid
deck over her at this level. Then on the deck they erected
a huge deck-house, with sloping sides pierced with port-holes
for ten heavy smooth-bore guns. The funnel passed
up through the roof of the deck-house. There were no
masts, only a flagstaff. The flat deck space, fore and aft,
and the sloping sides of the deck-house were to be armoured
with four inches of iron, but there were no armour plates
available. Railway iron was collected and rolled into long
narrow strips, and these were bolted on the structure in
two layers, laid crosswise in different directions. An
armoured conning-tower, low and three-sided, was built
on the front of the deck-house roof. The bow was armed
with a mass of iron, in order to revive the ancient method
of attack by ramming. Thus equipped the "Merrimac"
was commissioned, under the command of Commodore
Buchanan, and renamed the "Confederate States' ironclad
steam-ram 'Virginia,'" but the ship was always generally
known by her former name.</p>

<p>At noon on Saturday, 8 March, 1862, the "Merrimac"
started on her voyage down the Elizabeth River. It was
to be at once her trial trip and her first fighting expedition.
She was to attack and destroy the Federal blockading fleet
in Hampton Roads. Up to the last moment the ship was
crowded with working men. They were cleared out of her
as she cast off from the quay. As the "Merrimac" went
down the river the officers were telling off the men to their
stations. Not one of her guns had ever been fired. There
had been a few hurried drills. Everything was improvised.</p>

<p>The first disappointment was to find that with the engines
doing their best she could only make five knots. She steered
badly, answering her helm slowly and turning on a wide
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
circle. As one of her officers put it, "she was as unmanageable
as a water-logged vessel." She drew 22 feet of water,
so that she had to keep to the narrow channel in the middle
of the river, and the risk of getting hopelessly aground was
serious.</p>

<p>The Confederate troops crowded the batteries on either
bank, and cheered the "Merrimac" as she went slowly
down. It was a fine day, with bright sunshine and absolutely
no wind, and the broad stretch of water in Hampton
Roads was like a pond. At the same time a small squadron
of Confederate gunboats came down the James River to
co-operate in the attack. These ships were the "Yorktown"
(12 guns), the "Jamestown" (2 guns), and the
"Teaser" (1 gun). Two other gunboats, the "Beaufort"
and the "Raleigh," followed the "Merrimac." But the
chief hope of the attack was placed upon the ironclad.</p>

<p>The nine vessels of the blockading fleet lay along the
north side of Hampton Roads, from the point at Newport
News to Old Point Comfort, where the Roads open on
Chesapeake Bay. They were strung out over a distance
of about eight miles. The shore on that side was held by
the Federals, and the point at Newport News bristled with
batteries. Near the point were anchored the sailing
frigate "Congress," of 50 guns, and the sloop "Cumberland,"
a full-rigged three-master, armed with 30 guns. On
board the Federal ships there was not the remotest expectation
of attack. Clothes were drying in the rigging.
A crowd of boats lay alongside. It was known that the
Confederates had been busy converting the old "Merrimac"
into an armoured ram at Norfolk Navy Yard, but it was
not believed that she was yet ready for action. The men
had just eaten their dinners, and were having a pipe, when
the first alarm was raised. By the wharf at Newport News
lay a tug-boat, the "Zouave," which had been armed with
a 30-pounder gun, and was rated as a gunboat and tender
to the fleet. Her captain noticed the smoke of steamers
coming down the Elizabeth River, and cast off from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
wharf and went alongside the "Cumberland." The
officer of the watch told him to run across to the river
mouth and find out what was coming down from Norfolk.</p>

<p>"It did not take us long to find out," he says, "for we
had not gone over two miles when we saw what to all
appearances looked like the roof of a very big barn belching
forth smoke as from a chimney. We were all divided in
opinion as to what was coming. The boatswain's mate was
the first to make out the Confederate flag, and then we all
guessed it was the 'Merrimac' come at last."</p>

<p>The little "Zouave" fired half a dozen shots, which fell
short. The "Merrimac" took no notice of this demonstration,
but steadily held her way. Then the "Cumberland"
signalled to the "Zouave" to come back, and she
ran past the anchored warships and under shelter of the
batteries. These were now opening fire on the Confederate
gunboats issuing from the James River. The "Congress"
and "Cumberland" had cleared for action and weighed
anchor. Other ships of the fleet had taken the alarm, and
were coming up into the Roads to help their consorts.
The Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point opened fire at
long range against these ships as they stood into the Roads.</p>

<p>The "Merrimac" was steering straight for the "Cumberland,"
in grim silence, her unarmoured consorts keeping
well astern. When the range was about three-quarters of a
mile the two Federal ships opened fire with the heavy guns
mounted on pivots on their upper decks, and the shore
batteries also brought some guns to bear. A heavy cannonade
from sea and shore was now echoing over the landlocked
waters, but the "Merrimac" fired not a gun in
reply. A few cannon-shot struck her sloping armoured
sides, and rebounded with a ringing clang. The rest
ricochetted harmlessly over the water, throwing up
sparkling geysers of foam in the bright sunlight.</p>

<p>At last, when the range was only some 500 yards, the
bow-gun of the "Merrimac" was fired at the "Cumberland,"
with an aim so true that it killed or wounded most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of the men at one of her big pivot-guns. A moment after
the ram was abeam of the "Congress," and fired her starboard
battery of four guns into her at deadly close range.
With the projectiles from 25 guns of the "Congress" and
15 of the "Cumberland" rattling on her armour, riddling
her funnel, and destroying davits, rails, and deck-fittings,
the "Merrimac" steamed straight for the "Cumberland,"
which made an ineffectual attempt to avoid the coming
collision. At the last moment some men were killed and
wounded in the gun-deck of the ram by shots entering a
port-hole. Then came a grinding crash as the iron ram of
the "Merrimac" struck the "Cumberland" almost at
right angles on the starboard side under her fore-rigging.
On board the Confederate ship the shock was hardly felt.
But the "Cumberland" heeled over with the blow, and
righted herself again as the "Merrimac" reversed her
engines and cleared her, leaving a huge breach in the side
of her enemy. The ram had crushed in several of her
frames and made a hole in her side "big enough to drive a
coach and horses through." The water was pouring into
her like a mill-race.</p>

<p>From the "Merrimac," lying close alongside with silent
guns, came a hail and a summons to surrender. From the
deck of the "Cumberland" her commander, Morris,
replied with a curt refusal. The firing began again; the
"Cumberland's" men, driven from the gun-deck by the
inrush of rising water, took refuge on the upper deck. Some
jumped overboard and began swimming ashore. Others
kept her two pivot-guns in action for a few minutes. Then
with a lurch she went down. Boats from the shore saved
a few of her people. Those who watched from the batteries
could hardly believe their eyes as they saw the masts of the
warship sticking out of the water where a few minutes ago
the "Cumberland" had waited in confidence for the attack
of the improvised "rebel" ironclad.</p>

<p>As her adversary went down, the "Merrimac" turned
slowly to menace the "Congress" with the same swift
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
destruction. She took no notice of the harmless cannonade
from the shore. Lieutenant Smith, who commanded the
"Congress," had realized that collision with the enemy
meant destruction, rapid and inevitable, and decided that
his best chance was to get into shoal water under the
batteries. He had slipped his cable, shaken out some of
his sails, and signalled to the tug-boat "Zouave" to come
to his help. The "Zouave" made fast to the "Congress"
on the land side, but she had not moved far when the ship
grounded within easy range of the "Merrimac's" guns.
These were already in action against her.</p>

<p>The leading ship of the seaward Federal squadron, the
frigate "Minnesota," had come in within long range, and
opened on the "Merrimac" and the gunboats. But she
had only fired a few shots when she also ran aground on
the edge of the main channel, but in such a position that
some of her guns could still be brought to bear. Taking
no notice of this more distant foe, the "Merrimac" devoted
all her attention to the "Congress." She sent a
broadside into the stranded frigate, and then passing
under her stern, raked her fore and aft and set her on fire.
Lieutenant Smith, of the "Congress," was badly wounded.
Lieutenant Prendergast, who succeeded to the command,
decided that with his ship aground and the enemy able
quietly to cannonade her without coming under fire of
most of her guns, to prolong the fight would be to waste
life uselessly. After consulting his wounded chief he
dipped his colours and displayed a white flag. The little
"Zouave" cast off from the frigate, and as she cleared her,
fired a single shot from her one gun at the "Merrimac,"
and then ran down to the "Minnesota." This shot led
afterwards to a false report that the "Congress" had reopened
fire treacherously after surrendering.</p>

<p>Civil war has often been described as fratricidal. In
this action between the "Congress" and the "Merrimac"
two brothers were opposed to each other. Commodore
Buchanan, who commanded the "Merrimac," knew, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
he attacked the "Congress," that a younger brother of his
was a junior officer of the frigate. The younger man
escaped unscathed, but the commodore was slightly
wounded during the fight. When the "Congress" struck
her colours, Buchanan ordered two of the gunboats to take
off her crew. Her flag was secured to be sent to Richmond
as a trophy. While the gunboats "Raleigh" and "Beaufort"
were taking off the Federal wounded, there came
from the batteries on shore a heavy fire of guns and rifles.
Several of the wounded and two officers of the "Raleigh"
were killed, and the gunboats drew off, leaving most of the
crew of the "Congress" still on board. They escaped to
the shore in boats and by swimming. Meanwhile the
"Merrimac" fired a number of red-hot shot into her, and
she was soon ablaze fore and aft. Then the ironclad turned
and fired at the "Minnesota."</p>

<p>The sun was going down and the tide was running out
rapidly. The deep draught of the "Merrimac" made the
risk of grounding, if she closely engaged the "Minnesota,"
a serious matter. So Buchanan signalled to the gunboats
to cease fire, and, accompanied by them, steamed over to
the south side of the Roads, where he anchored for the
night under the Confederate batteries, intending to complete
the destruction of the Federal fleet next morning.</p>

<p>The first day's fight was over. It had been a battle between
the old and the new&mdash;between a steam-propelled
armoured ram and wooden sailing-ships. The "Cumberland"
had been sunk, the "Congress" forced to surrender
and set on fire, and the "Minnesota" was hopelessly
aground and marked down as the first victim for next
day. The Federals had lost some two hundred men. The
Confederates only twenty-one. Buchanan was wounded,
not severely, but seriously enough for the command of the
"Merrimac" to be transferred to Lieutenant Jones. As
night came on the moon rose, but the wide expanse of
water was lighted up, not by her beams only, but also by
the red glare from the burning "Congress." The flames
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
ran up her tarred rigging like rocket trails, masts and
spars were defined in flickers of flame. At last, with a
deafening roar that was heard for many a mile, she blew
up, strewing the Roads with scattered wreckage.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that evening, while the "Congress" was
still burning, a strange craft had steamed into the Roads
from the sea, all unnoticed by the Confederates. She
anchored in the shallow water between the "Minnesota"
and the shore. Her light draught enabled her to go into
waters where less powerful fighting-ships would have
grounded. To use the words of one who first saw her as
the sun rose next day, she looked like a plank afloat with
a can on top of it. She was Ericsson's ironclad turret-ship,
the "Monitor."</p>

<p>In the first weeks of the war inventors had besieged the
United States Navy Department with proposals for the
construction of ironclad warships. The Department was
still leisurely debating as to what policy should be adopted,
when news came that the "Merrimac," half-burnt at
Norfolk Yard, was being reconstructed as an armoured
ram, and it became urgent to provide an adversary to
meet her on something like equal terms. It was at this
moment that John Ericsson came forward with his offer
to construct an armoured light-draught turret-ship, which
could be very rapidly built and put in commission. This
last point was of cardinal importance, for report said that
work on the "Merrimac" was far advanced, and no ship
could be built on ordinary lines, of sufficient power to
meet her, in the time now available. The vessel must be
of light draught to work in the shallow coast waters, creeks,
and river mouths of the Southern States. She might have
to fight in narrow channels, where there would not be
room for man&#0339;uvring to bring broadside guns to bear.
Ericsson, therefore, proposed that her armament should
be a pair of heavy guns mounted in a turret, which could
be revolved so as to point them in any direction, independently
of the position of the ship herself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>The hull was to be formed of two portions, a kind of
barge-like structure or lower hull, built of iron, and mostly
under water when the ship was afloat, and fixed over this
the upper hull, a raft-like structure, wider and longer, and
with overhanging armoured sides and lighter deck-armour.
The dimensions were&mdash;</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li>Upper part of hull, length 172 feet, beam 41 feet.</li>
<li>Lower hull, length 122 feet, beam 34 feet.</li>
<li>Depth, underside of deck to keel-plate, 11 feet 2 inches.</li>
<li>Draught of water, 10 feet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Engines and boilers were aft, and the long overhang of
the armoured deck astern protected the under-water rudder
and screw propeller. In the overhang at the bow there
was a well, in which the anchor hung under water. Forward,
near the bow, there was a small armoured pilot-house,
or, as we now call it, "conning-tower." Amidships,
in an armoured turret, were mounted two heavy smooth-bore
guns, of large calibre, and throwing a round, solid
shot.</p>

<p>The conning-tower was built of solid iron blocks, nine
inches thick. The sight-holes were narrow, elongated slits.
This was the helmsman's station.</p>

<p>The committee to which Ericsson's plans were referred
was at first hostile; some of the members declared that
the ship would not float, that her deck would be under
water, and she would be swamped at once. Further
objections were that no crew could live in the under-water
part of the hull. But at length all objections were met,
and the Swedish engineer was told that his plans were
accepted, and that a regular contract would be drawn up
for his signature. Ericsson knew the value of time, and
before the contract was ready the keel plates of his turret-ship
had been rolled and a dozen firms had started work
on her various parts. While the ship was being built, he
proposed she should be named the "Monitor," and the
name became a general term for low-freeboard turret-ships.</p>

<p>The keel of the ship was laid at Greenpoint Yard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Brooklyn, in October, 1861. She was launched on 30
January, 1862. The work of completing and fitting was
carried on day and night, and she was commissioned for
service on 25 February, 1862. But even when her crew
were on board there were a number of details to be completed.
Workmen were busy on her almost up to the
moment of her departure from New York harbour nine
days later, so there was no chance of drilling the men and
testing the guns and turret.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Worden, United States Navy, was promoted
to the rank of captain and given command. He formed a
crew of volunteers for what was considered a novel and
exceptionally dangerous service. Officers and men numbered
fifty-eight in all.</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday, 6 March (two days before
the "Merrimac's" attack on the "Cumberland"), the
"Monitor" left New York in tow of the tug "Seth Low,"
bound for Hampton Roads. The two days' voyage southwards
along the coast was an anxious and trying time, and
though the weather was not really bad, the "Monitor"
narrowly escaped foundering at sea.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. on the Saturday she was off Cape Henry,
and the sound of a far-off cannonade was heard in the
direction of Hampton Roads. The officers rightly guessed
that the "Merrimac" was in action. It was after dark
that the turret-ship steamed up the still water of the landlocked
bay, amid the red glare from the burning "Congress."
She anchored beside the United States warship
"Roanoke." On board the fleet which eagerly watched
her arrival there were general disappointment and depression
at seeing how small she was.</p>

<p>Worden shifted his anchorage in the night, and taking
advantage of the "Monitor's" light draught steamed up
the Roads, and anchored his ship in the shallow water to
landward of the stranded "Minnesota."</p>

<p>There was not much sleep on board the "Monitor" that
night, tired as the men were. At 2 a.m. the "Congress"

blew up in a series of explosions. After that the men tried
to settle down to rest, but before dawn all hands were
roused to prepare for the coming fight. A little after
7 a.m. the "Merrimac" was seen steaming slowly across
the bay, escorted by her flotilla of gunboats. She was
coming to complete the destruction of the United States
squadron, and had marked down the "Minnesota" as
her first victim, in blissful ignorance of the arrival of
the "Monitor." Worden realized that if he allowed the
fight to take place near the stranded ship, the "Merrimac"
might engage him with one of her broadsides, and use the
other to destroy the "Minnesota." He therefore steamed
boldly out into the open water, challenging the Confederate
ram to a duel. As he approached the wooden gunboats
prudently turned back and ran under the shelter of the
Confederate batteries on the south shore, leaving the
"Merrimac" to meet the "Monitor" in single combat.</p>

<p>So that Sunday morning, 9 March, 1862, saw the first
battle between ironclad ships, with North and South,
soldiers, sailors, and civilians anxiously watching the
combat from the ships in the Roads and the batteries on
either shore.</p>

<p>Worden was in the pilot-house with a quartermaster at
the wheel, and a local pilot to assist him. His first lieutenant,
Dana Greene, commanded the two 11-inch guns
in the turret. The "Merrimac" was the first to open fire.
Worden waited to reply till she was at close quarters, then
stopped his engines, let his ship drift, and sent the order
by speaking-tube to the turret, "Commence firing!"
The "Monitor's" turret swung round, and her two guns
roared out, enveloping both ships in a fog of powder smoke
as the huge cannon-balls crashed on the sloping armour of
the "Merrimac." They did not penetrate it, but the theory
of the Northern artillerists was that the hammering of
heavy round shot on an enemy's armour would start the
plates, shear bolt and rivet heads, and crush in the wooden
backing, and so gradually succeed in making a breach in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the armour somewhere. But throughout this fight at
close quarters the "Merrimac's" cuirass remained intact.</p>

<span class="smcap">the battle of hampton roads. the merrimac and monitor engaged at close quarters</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>The Southern ship was replying with a much more rapid
fire from her broadside guns. Hit after hit thundered on
the "Monitor's" turret, but its plating held good, though
the sensation of being thus pummelled was anything but
pleasant to the men inside. At an early stage of the fight
a quartermaster was disabled in a startling way. He was
leaning against the inside of the turret, when a shot struck
it just outside. The momentary yielding of the plating to
the blow passed on the shock to the man's body, and he
fell stunned and collapsed, and had to be carried below.</p>

<p>Although the speaking-tube from conning-tower to
turret was inside the armoured deck, a similar action of
a shot, that did not penetrate, smashed it up, and after
this orders had to be passed with difficulty by a chain of
men. And this was not the only trouble the crew of the
"Monitor" had to contend with. But the "Monitor,"
with all her defects, had the great advantage over the
"Merrimac" of a slightly greater speed and of a much
greater handiness. Her turning circle was much smaller
than that of the larger ship, and she could choose her
position, and evade with comparative ease any attempt
of her clumsy adversary to ram and run her down. The
"Merrimac," with her damaged funnel and diminished
draught on her furnaces, found it even more difficult than
on the previous day to get up speed. At times she was
barely moving. Her depth was also a drawback in the
narrow channel. While the light-draught "Monitor"
could go anywhere, the "Merrimac," drawing 22 feet
of water, was more than once aground, and was got afloat
again after many anxious efforts.</p>

<p>The "Monitor" had a good supply of solid shot; the
"Merrimac" very few, for she had been sent out, not to
fight an armour-clad, but to destroy a wooden fleet.
Finding that his shell-fire was making no impression on
the "Monitor's" turret, and recognizing the difficulty of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
ramming his enemy, Commander Jones made up his mind
to disregard the "Monitor" for a while, and attempt to
complete the destruction of the "Minnesota." He therefore
ordered his pilot to steer across the Roads, and take
up a position near the stranded frigate. The pilot afterwards
confessed that he was more anxious about facing
the rapid fire of the "Minnesota's" numerous guns than
standing the more deliberate attack of the "Monitor's"
slow fire. He could have brought the "Merrimac" within
half a mile of the "Minnesota," but he made a wide detour,
and ran aground two miles from the Federal ship. When
after great efforts the ironclad was floated again, the pilot
declared he could not take her any nearer the "Minnesota"
without grounding again, and Commander Jones
reluctantly turned to renew the duel with the "Monitor,"
which had been steaming slowly after him. The "Monitor's"
officers thought the "Merrimac" was running
away from them, and were surprised when she closed
with their ship again.</p>

<p>Once more there was a fight at close quarters. Those
who watched the battle could make out very little of
what was happening, for the two ships were wrapped in
clouds of powder smoke and blacker smoke from their
furnaces. The "Merrimac's" funnel was down, and the
smoke from her furnace-room was pouring low over her
casemate. In the midst of the semi-darkness Jones tried
to ram the turret-ship, and nearly succeeded. Worden,
using the superior handiness of his little vessel, converted
the direct attack into a glancing blow, but the Confederates
thought that if they had not lost the iron wedge of their
ram the day before in sinking the "Cumberland" they
would have sunk the "Monitor."</p>

<p>The turret-ship now kept a more respectful distance.
For more than a quarter of an hour she did not fire a shot.
The Confederates hoped they had permanently disabled
her, but what had happened was that the "Monitor"
had ceased fire in order to pass a supply of ammunition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
up into the turret, which could not be revolved while this
was being done. Presently the "Monitor" began firing
again. Jones of the "Merrimac" now changed his target.
Despairing of seriously damaging the "Monitor's" turret,
he concentrated his fire on her conning-tower, and before
long this plan had an important result. Dana Greene
gives a vivid description of the incident:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A shell struck the forward side of the pilot-house
directly in the sight-hole or slit, and exploded, cracking the
second iron log and partly lifting the top, leaving an opening.
Worden was standing immediately behind this spot,
and received in his face the force of the blow, which partly
stunned him, and filling his eyes with powder, utterly
blinded him. The injury was known only to those in the
pilot-house and its immediate vicinity. The flood of light
rushing through the top of the pilot-house, now partly
open, caused Worden, blind as he was, to believe that the
pilot-house was seriously injured if not destroyed; he,
therefore, gave orders to put the helm to starboard, and
'sheer off.' Thus the 'Monitor' retired temporarily from
the action, in order to ascertain the extent of the injuries
she had received. At the same time Worden sent for me,
and I went forward at once, and found him standing at the
foot of the ladder leading to the pilot-house.</p>

<p>"He was a ghastly sight, with his eyes closed and the
blood apparently rushing from every pore in the upper part
of his face. He told me that he was seriously wounded, and
directed me to take command. I assisted in leading him to
a sofa in his cabin, where he was tenderly cared for by Dr.
Logue, and then I assumed command. Blind and suffering
as he was, Worden's fortitude never forsook him; he
frequently asked from his bed of pain of the progress of
affairs, and when told that the 'Minnesota' was saved, he
said, 'Then I can die happy!'"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>In the confusion that followed the disablement of her
commander, the "Monitor" had drifted away from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
"Merrimac," but still in a position between her and the
"Minnesota." The Confederate ship fired at the temporarily
disabled turret-ship a few shots, to which there
was no reply. Commander Jones and his officers believed
they had put their opponent out of action. But the "Merrimac"
was not in a position to profit by her advantage. It
was near 2 p.m. The tide was running out rapidly, and the
risk of grounding was serious. Ammunition was beginning
to be scarce. The crew was exhausted, and the ship's
pumps had to be kept going, for under the strain of the
heavy firing, and the repeated groundings during the two
days, the hull was leaking badly. Jones judged the time
had come to break off the action, and the "Merrimac"
turned slowly, and began to steam into the Elizabeth River,
on her way back to Norfolk.</p>

<p>The "Monitor," seeing her retiring, fired a few long-range
shots after her. They splashed harmlessly into the water.
So the famous fight ended.</p>

<p>On board both ships no life had been lost, and only a few
men were wounded, Captain Worden's case being the most
serious. In fact, there were fewer casualties than on the
first day, when the loss of life in the wooden ships had been
serious, and the "Merrimac," despite her armour, had had
twenty-one men killed and wounded by the lighter projectiles
of the "Cumberland" and "Congress" finding
their way into her casemate through the port-holes.
Neither ship had suffered severe injury, though if the
battle had continued, the damage done to the conning-tower
of the "Monitor" might have had serious results.
When the "Merrimac" was docked at Gosport Yard,
Norfolk, to be overhauled and repaired, it was found that
she had ninety-seven indentations on her armour. Twenty
of these were judged to be the marks of the "Monitor's"
11-inch balls. In these places the outer layer of armour-plating
was cracked and badly damaged. The under layer
and the wood backing were uninjured. The other seventy-seven
marks were mere surface dents made by the lighter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
artillery of the wooden ships. The "Monitor" had used
reduced charges of 15 pounds of gunpowder, and it was
believed that if the full charge of 30 pounds had been
used, the results might have been more serious, but the
Navy Department had ordered the reduced charge, as
it was feared that with full charges the strain on the gun-mountings
and turret-gear would be too severe. The
"Merrimac's" funnel was riddled, and all outside fittings
shot away. Two of her guns had been made unserviceable
on the first day by shots striking their muzzles.</p>

<p>Both sides claimed the victory in the Sunday's battle.
The Confederates claimed to have driven off the "Monitor,"
and stated that Jones had waited for some time for her to
renew the fight, before he turned back to Norfolk. The
Federals argued that the object of the "Merrimac" was
to destroy the "Minnesota," and the "Monitor" had prevented
this, and was therefore the victor. The frigate was
successfully floated next tide. Sometimes the fight is
described as a drawn battle, but most writers on the subject
accept the Federal contention, and give the honours of the
day to the little turret-ship.</p>

<p>The battle of Hampton Roads was notable, however, not
so much for its immediate results, as for its effect on naval
opinion and policy. It finally closed the era of unarmoured
ships; it led to a perhaps exaggerated importance being
attached to the ram as a weapon of attack; and it led to a
very general adoption of the armoured turret, and for a
while to the building of low-freeboard turret-ships in
various navies. It was not till long after that the story of
the "Monitor's" perilous voyage from New York was
told, and thus even in America it was not realized that the
"Monitor" type was fit only for smooth waters, and was
ill adapted for sea-going ships. On the Federal side there
was a kind of enthusiasm for the "Monitor." Numbers of
low-freeboard turret-ships of somewhat larger size, and
with improved details, were built for the United States,
and even the failure of Admiral Dupont's "Monitor"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
fleet in the attack on the Charleston batteries did not
convince the Navy Department that the type was defective.
Ericsson's building of the "Monitor" to meet the emergency
of 1862 was a stroke of genius, but its success had
for a long time a misleading effect on the development of
naval construction in the United States.</p>

<p>The "Merrimac" was abandoned and burned by the
Confederates a few weeks later when they evacuated
Norfolk and the neighbourhood. At the end of the year
the "Monitor" was ordered to Charleston. She started in
tow of a powerful tug, but the fate she had so narrowly
escaped on her first voyage overtook her. She was caught
in a gale off Cape Hatteras on the evening of 31 December,
1862. The tow-ropes had to be cut, and shortly after
midnight the "Monitor" sank ten miles off the Cape.
Several of her officers and men went down with her. The
rest were rescued by the tug, with great difficulty.</p>

<p>Had the wind blown a little harder during the "Monitor's"
first voyage from New York, or had the tow-rope
to which she hung parted, there is no doubt she would
have gone down in the same way. In that case the course
of history would have been different, for the "Merrimac"
would have been undisputed master of the Atlantic coast,
and have driven off or destroyed every ship of the blockading
squadrons. The fates of nations sometimes depend
on trifles. That of the American Union depended for some
hours on the soundness of the hawser by which the "Monitor"
hung on to the tug-boat "Seth Low" of New York.</p>

<p class="title">
LISSA<br />
1866</p>


<p>In the American Civil War there had been no battle
between ironclad fleets. "Monitors" had engaged
batteries. The "Merrimac" had had her duel with the
first of the little turret-ships. But experts were still
wondering what would happen when fleets of armoured
ships, built in first-class dockyards, met in battle on the sea.</p>

<p>The war between Austria and Italy in 1866 gave the first
answer. The experiment was not a completely satisfactory
one, and some of its lessons were misread. Others were soon
made obsolete by new developments in naval armaments.</p>

<p>Still, Lissa will always count among the famous sea-fights
of the world, for it was the first conflict in which the armoured
sea-going ship took a leading part. But there is
another reason: it proved in the most startling way&mdash;though
neither for the first time nor the last&mdash;that men
count for more than machines, that courage and enterprise
can reverse in the actual fight the conditions that
beforehand would seem to make defeat inevitable. "Give
me plenty of iron in the men, and I don't mind so much
about iron in the ships," was a pithy saying of the American
Admiral Farragut. There was iron enough in the Austrian
sailors, Tegethoff and Petz, to outweigh all the iron in the
guns and armour of the Italian admirals, Persano and
Albini, and the "iron in the men" gave victory to the
fleet that on paper was doomed to destruction.</p>

<p>At the present time, when in our morning papers and in
the monthly reviews we find such frequent comparisons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
between the fleets of the Powers, comparisons almost invariably
based only on questions of ships, armour, guns,
and horse-power, and leaving the all-important human
factor out of account, it will be interesting to compare the
relative strength&mdash;on paper&mdash;of the Austrian and Italian
fleets in 1866, before telling the story of Lissa.</p>

<p>Austria had only seven ironclads. All were of the earlier
type of armour-clad ships, modelled on the lines of the old
steam frigates, built of wood, and plated with thin armour.
The two largest&mdash;ships of 5000 tons and 800 horse-power&mdash;mounted
a battery of eighteen 48-pounder smooth bores.
They had not a single rifled gun in their weak broadsides.
These were the "Ferdinand Max" and the "Hapsburg."
The "Kaiser Max," the "Prinz Eugen," and "Don Juan
de Austria" were smaller ships of 3500 tons and 650 horse-power,
but they had a slightly better armament, sixteen
smooth-bore muzzle-loading 48-pounders, and fourteen
rifled guns, light breech-loading 24-pounders. The "Salamander"
and the "Drache" were ships of 3000 tons and
500 horse-power. They mounted sixteen rifled 24-pounders
and ten smooth-bore 48-pounders. These five smaller ironclads
were the only ships under the Austrian flag at all up
to date. There were an old wooden screw line-of-battle ship
and four wooden frigates, but these had neither rifled guns
nor armour, and the naval critics of the day would doubtless
refuse to take them into account. Then there were some
wooden unarmoured gunboats and dispatch vessels.</p>

<p>Now turning to the Italian Navy List, we find that these
six ironclads, two of them without a single rifled gun, would
have to face no less than twelve armoured ships, every one
of them carrying rifled guns. One of them was a thoroughly
up-to-date vessel, just commissioned from Armstrong's
yard at Elswick, the armoured turret-ram "Affondatore"
(i.e. "The Sinker"). A correspondent of "The Times"
saw her when she put into Cherbourg on the way down
Channel. He reported that she looked formidable enough
to sink the whole Austrian ironclad fleet single-handed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
She was a ship of 4000 tons and 750 horse-power, iron-built,
heavily armoured, and with a spur-bow for ramming.
She carried in her turret two 10-inch rifled Armstrong
guns, throwing an armour-piercing shell of 295 pounds&mdash;say
300-pounders, and let us remember the heaviest
rifled gun in the Austrian fleet was the little 24-pounder.
Then there were two wooden ironclads of 5700 tons and
800 horse-power, the "Re d'Italia" and the "Re di
Portogallo." The "Re di Portogallo" carried 28 rifled
guns, two 300-pounders, twelve 100-pounders, and fourteen
74-pounders. The "Re d'Italia" mounted thirty-two
rifled guns, two 150-pounders, sixteen 100-pounders,
fourteen 74-pounders, and besides these four smooth-bore
50-pounders. On paper these three ships, the two
"Kings"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the "Affondatore," ought to have blown
the Austrian ironclads out of the sea or sent them to the
bottom. Let us compare the number of rifled guns and
the weight of metal. There is no need to count the smooth-bores,
for the "Merrimac-Monitor" fight had proved how
little they could do even against weak armour. Here is
the balance-sheet:&mdash;</p>

<p>What could the seven Austrian ironclads with their 74
little guns throwing 1776 pounds of metal do against these
nine ships with double the number of guns and nearly ten
times the weight of metal in their broadsides? But add
in the three capital ships before noted on the Italian side,
and we have:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li>12 ironclads against 7.</li>
<li>208 rifled guns against 74.</li>
<li>20,392 pounds of metal in the broadsides against only 1776.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly it would be mad folly for the Austrian fleet to
challenge a conflict! It would be swept from the Adriatic
at the first encounter!</p>

<p>Here, then, are our calculations as to the command of
the Adriatic at the outset of the war of 1866. They leave
out of account only one element&mdash;the men, and the spirit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of the men. Let us see how the grim realities of war can
give the lie to paper estimates.</p>

<p>Wilhelm von Tegethoff, who commanded the Austrian
fleet with the rank of rear-admiral, was one of the world's
great sailors, and the man for the emergency. He had as
a young officer taken part in the blockade of Venice during
the revolution of 1848 and 1849; he had seen something
of the naval operations in the Black Sea during the Crimean
War, as the commander of a small Austrian steamer, and
during the war of 1864 he had commanded the wooden
steam frigate "Schwarzenberg" in the fight with the
Danes off Heligoland. Besides these war services he had
taken part in an exploring expedition in the Red Sea and
Somaliland, and he had made more than one voyage as
staff-captain to the Archduke Maximilian, whose favourite
officer and close friend he had been for years. When the
Archduke, an enthusiastic sailor, resigned his command
of the Austrian fleet to embark for Mexico, where a short-lived
reign as Emperor and a tragic death awaited him,
he told his brother, the Emperor Francis Joseph, that
Tegethoff was the hope of the Austrian navy.</p>

<p>The young admiral (he was not yet forty years of age)
had concentrated his fleet at Pola, the Austrian naval
port near Trieste. He had got together every available
ship, not only the seven ironclads, but the old line-of-battle
ship and the wooden frigates and gunboats. The Admiralty
at Vienna had suggested that he should take only the ironclads
to sea, but he had replied: "Give me every ship you
have. You may depend on my finding some good use for
them." He believed in his officers and men, and relied
on them to make a good fight on board anything that would
float, whether the naval experts considered it was out of
date or not. Among his officers he had plenty of men who
were worthy of their chief and inspired with his own
dauntless spirit, and the crews were largely composed of
excellent material, men from the wilderness of creek and
island that extends along the Illyrian and Dalmatian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
shores, fishermen and coasting sailors, many of them so
lately joined that instead of uniform they still wore their
picturesque native costume. The crew looked a motley
lot, but, to use Farragut's phrase, "there was iron in the
men."</p>

<p>Twenty-seven ships in all, small and large, were moored
in four lines in the roadstead of Fasana, near Pola. But
they did not remain idly at their anchors. Every day
some of them ran out to sea, to fire at moving targets or
to practise rapid turning and ramming floating rafts.
The bows were strengthened by cross timbers in all the
larger ships, and in the target work the crews were taught
to concentrate the fire of several guns on one spot. But
Tegethoff knew he had not a single gun in his fleet that
could pierce the armour of the Italian vessels. He told
his officers that for decisive results they must trust to the
ram. He had painted his ships a dead black. The Italian
colour was grey. "When we get into the fight," said
Tegethoff, "you must ram away at anything you see
painted grey."</p>

<p>War was declared on 20 June. Tegethoff had been
training his fleet since 9 May, and was ready for action.
He at once sent out the "Stadion" (a passenger steamer
of the Austrian Lloyd line, employed as a scout and armed
with two 12-pounders) to reconnoitre the Italian coast of
the Adriatic. The "Stadion" returned on the 23rd
with news that though war had been expected for weeks
the Italian fleet was not yet concentrated. A few of the
ships were at Ancona, but the greater part of it was reported
to be at Taranto, with Admiral Count Persano,
the commander-in-chief, who from the first displayed the
strangest irresolution.</p>

<p>Tegethoff was anxious to attempt to engage the division
at Ancona before it was joined by the main body from
Taranto, but he was held back by orders from his Government
directing him to remain in the Northern Adriatic
covering Venice. It was not till 26 June that he obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
a free hand within limits defined by an order not to go
further south than the fortified island of Lissa.</p>

<p>He left Pola that evening with six ironclads, the wooden
frigate "Schwarzenberg," five gunboats, and the scouting
steamer "Stadion." He had hoisted his rear-admiral's
flag on the "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He made for
Ancona, and was off the port at dawn next day. The first
shots of the naval war were fired in the grey of the morning,
when three of the Austrian gunboats chased the Italian
dispatch vessel "Esploratore" into the port, outside of
which she had been on the look-out. The Austrians were
able clearly to see and count the warships under the
batteries in the harbour. Besides other craft, there were
eleven of Persano's twelve ironclads, the squadron from
Taranto having reached Ancona the day before. Only the
much-vaunted "Affondatore" had not yet joined.</p>

<p>Tegethoff cleared for action, and steamed up and down
for some hours, just beyond the range of the coast batteries.
It was a challenge to the Italians to come out and fight.
But Persano did not accept it. He afterwards made excuses
to his Government, saying he had not yet completed the
final fitting out of his ships. The moral effect on both
fleets was important. The Austrians felt an increased
confidence in their daring leader and a growing contempt
for their adversaries. On the 24th the Austrian army, under
the Archduke Albert, had beaten the Italians at Custozza,
and the Austrian navy looked forward to the same good
fortune. The Italians were depressed both by the news
of Custozza and the hesitation of their admiral to risk
anything.</p>

<p>Early in the day Tegethoff started on his return voyage
to Fasana, where he arrived in the evening, and found the
ironclad "Hapsburg" waiting to join his flag, after having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
been refitted in the dockyard of Pola. As there were now
persistent rumours that the Italians were going to attempt
an attack on Venice, Tegethoff remained in the Fasana
roadstead, continuing the training of his fleet. On 6 July
he again took it to sea, practised fleet man&#0339;uvres under
steam, and showed himself in sight of Ancona. But the
Italian fleet was still lying idly in the harbour, and Tegethoff
once more returned to Fasana in the hope that Persano
would attempt some enterprise, during which he would be
able to fall upon him in the open.</p>

<p>The Italian admiral was meanwhile wasting time in
lengthy correspondence with his Government, and sending
it letters which revealed his irresolution and incompetence
so plainly that they ought to have led to his immediate
supersession. He complained he had not definite orders,
though he had been directed to destroy the Austrian fleet,
if it put to sea, or blockade it, if it remained in harbour.
He explained now that he was mounting better guns in
some of his ships, now that he was waiting for the "Affondatore"
to join. Once he actually wrote saying that some
new ironclads ought to be purchased from other powers to
reinforce him. At last he was plainly told that if he did
not at once do something for the honour of the Italian
navy he would be relieved of his command. With the
Austrians victorious in Northern Italy, a raid on Venice
would have been too serious an operation, but he proposed
as an alternative that a small land force should be embarked
for a descent on the fortified island of Lissa, on the
Dalmatian coast. His fleet would escort it, and co-operate
by bombarding the island batteries. The plan was accepted,
and he proceeded to execute it.</p>

<p>It was about as bad a scheme as could be imagined. It
is a recognized principle of war that over-sea expeditions
should only be undertaken when the enemy's fleet has
been either rendered helpless by a crushing defeat or
blockaded in its ports. Before sending the transports to
Lissa Persano should have steamed across to Pola and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
blockaded Tegethoff, fighting him if he came out. But
Persano had a delusive hope that he could perhaps score a
victory without encountering the Austrian fleet by swooping
down on Lissa, crushing the batteries with a heavy
bombardment, landing the troops, hoisting the Italian
flag, and getting back to his safe anchorage at Ancona
before Tegethoff could receive news of what was happening,
and come out and force on a battle.</p>

<p>Lissa was defended by a garrison of 1800 men, under
Colonel Urs de Margina. This small body of troops held
a number of forts and batteries mounting eighty-eight
guns, none of them of large calibre. The works were old,
and had been hurriedly repaired. Most of them dated
from the time of the English occupation of the island during
the Napoleonic wars.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Persano expected that Lissa would
be a very easy nut to crack.</p>

<p>On 16 July the Italian fleet sailed from Ancona. Even
now Persano carried out his operations with leisurely
deliberation. On the 17th he reconnoitred Lissa, approaching
in his flagship under French colours. Early on
the 18th the fleet closed in upon the island, flying French
colours, till it was in position before the batteries.</p>

<p>The commandant had cable communication with Pola
by a line running by Lesina to the mainland. He reported
to Tegethoff the appearance of the disguised fleet, and
then the opening of the attack on his batteries. At first
the Austrian admiral could hardly believe that the Italians
had committed themselves to such an ill-judged enterprise,
and thought that the attack on Lissa might be only a
feint meant to draw his fleet away from the Northern
Adriatic, and leave an opening for a dash at Pola, Trieste,
or Venice itself. But cablegrams describing the progress
of the attack convinced him it was meant to be pressed
home, and he telegraphed to Colonel de Margina, telling
him to hold out to the last extremity, and promising to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
come to his relief with all the fleet. This message did not
reach the colonel, for just before it was dispatched an
Italian ship had cut the cable between Lissa and Lesina,
and seized the telegraph office of the latter island. Tegethoff's
message thus fell into Persano's hands. He persuaded
himself that it was mere bluff, intended to encourage
the commandant of Lissa to hold out as long as possible.
He thought Tegethoff would remain in the Northern
Adriatic to protect or to overawe Venice.</p>

<p>The attempt to reduce the batteries of Lissa by bombardment
during the 18th proved a failure. In the evening
Persano was in a very anxious state of mind. He had
made no arrangements for colliers to supply his fleet, and
his coal was getting low. It was just possible that Tegethoff
might come out and force him to fight, and he thought of
returning to Ancona. But if he did he would be dismissed
from his command. At last he made up his mind to land
the troops next morning, and try to carry the forts by an
assault combined with an attack from the sea. His second
in command, Admiral Albini, with the squadron of wooden
ships and gunboats that accompanied the ironclads, was
directed to superintend and assist in the landing of the
troops. They were to be embarked in all available boats,
and to land at 9 a.m. During the night the ram "Affondatore"
joined the fleet, and Persano had all his twelve
ironclads before Lissa.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th the sea was smooth, and
covered with a hot haze that limited the view. The soldiers
were being got into the boats, and the ships were steaming
to their stations for the attack, when about eight o'clock
the "Esploratore," which had been sent off to scout to
the north-westward, appeared steaming fast out of a bank
of haze with a signal flying, which was presently read,
"Suspicious-looking ships in sight." Tegethoff was
coming.</p>

<p>He had left Fasana late on the afternoon of the 18th,
with every available ship, large and small, new and old,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
wooden wall and ironclad. He would find work for all of
them. All night he had steamed for Lissa, anxious at the
sudden cessation of the cable messages, but still hoping
that he would see the Austrian flag flying on its forts, or
if not, that he would at least find the enemy's fleet still in
its waters.</p>

<p class="caption center">
<span class="smcap">LISSA. battle formation of the austrian fleet</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>He had organized his fleet in three divisions. The first
under his own personal command was formed of the seven
ironclads. The second division, under Commodore von
Petz, was composed of wooden unarmoured ships. The
commodore's flag flew on the old steam line-of-battle ship
"Kaiser," a three-decker with ninety-two guns on her
broadsides, all smooth-bores except a couple of rifled 24-pounders.
With the "Kaiser" were five old wooden ships
("Novara," "Schwarzenberg," "Donau," "Adria," and
"Radetzky") and a screw corvette, the "Erzherzog
Friedrich." The third division, under Commandant Eberle,
was composed of ten gunboats. A dispatch-boat was
attached to each of the leading divisions, and the scout
"Stadion," the swiftest vessel in the fleet, was at the immediate
disposal of the admiral, and was sent on in advance.</p>

<p>The fleet steamed during the night in the order of battle
that Tegethoff had chosen. The divisions followed each
other in succession, each in a wedge formation, the flagship
of the division in the centre with the rest of the ships to
port and starboard, not in line abreast, but each a little
behind the other. The formation will be understood
from the annexed <a href="#plan12">diagram</a>.</p>

<p>It was an anxious night for the Austrian admiral. For
some hours there was bad weather. Driving showers of
fine rain from a cloudy sky made it difficult at times to
see the lights of the ships, and it was no easy matter for
them to keep their stations. The sea was for a while so
rough that the ironclads had to close their ports, and there
was a danger that if the weather did not improve and the
sea become smoother they would not be able to fight most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of their guns. But Tegethoff held steadily on his course
for Lissa. On sea, as on land, there are times in the crisis
of a war when the highest prudence is to throw all ordinary
rules of prudence aside, and take all risks.</p>

<p>The admiral had resolved from the outset that, whatever
might be the result, the Austrian fleet should not lie in
safety under the protection of shore batteries, leaving the
Italian command of the Adriatic unchallenged. He felt
that it would be better to sink in the open sea, in a hopeless
fight against desperate odds, rather than ingloriously
to survive the war, without making an effort to carry his
flag to victory. So he steamed through the night, followed
by his strange array of ships that another leader might well
have considered as little better than useless encumbrances,
and in front the handful of inferior ironclads that might
well be regarded as equally doomed to destruction when
they met the more numerous and more heavily armed
ships of the enemy. But he had put away all thoughts of
safety. He was staking every ship and every man and his
own life against the faint chance of success. The coming
day might see his fleet destroyed, but such a failure would
be no disgrace. On the contrary, it would only be less
honourable than a well-won victory, and would be an
inspiration to the men of a future fleet that would
carry the banner of the Hapsburgs in later days. So he
rejoiced greatly when, as the day came, the weather
began to clear, and the "Stadion" signalled back that Lissa
was still holding out and the enemy's fleet lay under its
shores.</p>

<p>As soon as he read the "Esploratore's" signal, Persano
had no doubt that Tegethoff was upon him. He countermanded
the attack on Lissa, ordered Albini to re-embark
the troops, and proceeded to form his ironclads in line of
battle, intending to engage the enemy with these only.
The ironclads were standing in to attack the batteries of
San Giorgio at the north-east end of the island. Persano
formed nine of them in three divisions, which were to follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
each other in line ahead, the ram "Affondatore" being
out of the line and to starboard of the second division.

<p>The two other Italian ironclads, the "Formidabile"
and the "Varese," were not in the line, and took no part
in the coming battle. The "Formidabile" had suffered
heavily in the attack on the shore batteries, numerous
shells entering her port-holes and making a slaughterhouse
of her gun-deck. She had been ordered to Ancona,
and had left Lissa in the early morning. The "Varese"
had been detached to assist in operations on the other
side of the island, and joined Albini's squadron of wooden
ships while the fight was in progress. Persano's battle line
first steered west along the north side of Lissa. About
ten o'clock the driving mist on the sea cleared, and the
Austrian fleet was then seen approaching on a S.S.E.
course. Persano altered his own course, and, led by Vacca
in the "Principe di Carignano," the Italian ironclads
turned in succession on a N.N.E. course. Thus as the
Austrians closed on them the fleet in a sinuous line was
steering across the bows of the attacking ships.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Persano changed his flag
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
from the "Re d' Italia" to the "Affondatore," the former
ship slowing down to enable the admiral to leave her, and
thus producing a wide gap between Vacca's and Faa di
Bruno's divisions. The result of this sudden change of
flagship was confusing, as most of the Italian ships were
unaware of it, and still looked to the "Re d' Italia" for
guidance, and did not notice signals made by the "Affondatore."</p>

<p>Tegethoff had given the successive signals as the mist
dispersed, "Clear for action&mdash;Close order&mdash;Look-out ships
return to their stations&mdash;Full speed ahead." As the last
of the fog disappeared and the sun shone out, he saw to
his delight the Austrian flag still flying on the hill-side
batteries of Lissa, and close in front between him and the
island shores the enemy's fleet crossing his bows. Out
fluttered his battle signal, "<i>Ironclads will ram and sink
the enemy!</i>" A final signal was being prepared, "<i>Muss
Sieg von Lissa werden!</i>" ("There must be a victory of
Lissa!"), but the close encounter had begun, and the ships
were wrapped in clouds of powder-smoke before it could
be hoisted.</p>

<p>While Persano was passing from the "Re d' Italia" to
the ram "Affondatore," Vacca had begun the fight by
firing his broadside at the advancing Austrians. The
"Castelfidardo" and the "Ancona" followed his example.
But Tegethoff held his fire, waiting for close quarters.
One of these first shots killed Captain Moll of the "Drache"
on the bridge of his ship. A young lieutenant took command
of her. He was Weiprecht, who in later years
became famous as the commander of the Austrian exploring
ship "Tegethoff" in the Arctic regions.</p>

<p class="caption center">
<span class="smcap">BATTLE OF LISSA<br />the austrian attack at the beginning of the battle</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>As the fleets closed the Austrians opened fire, aiming,
not at the armoured sides of the enemy, which no gun of
theirs could penetrate, but at their port-holes and bridges.
Tegethoff in his flagship the "Ferdinand Max" was
looking for something to ram, but in the dense mass of
smoke he passed through the wide gap between Vacca's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
division and the "Re d'Italia," then finding no enemy in
his front, he turned and went back into the battle fog of
the Italian centre. The three ironclads on his left ("Hapsburg,"
"Salamander," and "Kaiser Max") were engaged
with Vacca's division, the van of the Italian fleet. The
three others, "Don Juan," "Drache," and "Prinz Eugen,"
had flung themselves on Faa di Bruno's ships in the centre.
Von Petz coming up with the wooden ships gallantly
attacked Ribotti's rearward division, any one of which
should in theory have been able to dispose of his entire
force. The gunboats hung on the margin of the fight,
which had now become a confused m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. And while the
Austrian wooden ships were thus risking themselves in
close action, Albini's Italian division of wooden ships
looked on from a safe distance.</p>

<p>One can only tell some of the striking incidents of the
battle, without being able even to fix the precise order of
time in which they occurred. When the "Merrimac"
sank the "Cumberland" with one blow of her ram in
Hampton Roads, the Federal ship was at anchor. But
even in the confusion and semi-darkness of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e at
Lissa it was found that it was not such an easy matter
to ram a ship under way. The blow was generally eluded
by a turn of the helm. Von Petz's flagship, the old three-decker
"Kaiser," towering amid the battle-smoke, attracted
the attention of Persano in the "Affondatore,"
and seemed an easy victim for his ram. But the big ironclad
was unhandy, and took eight minutes to turn a full
circle, and twice Petz eluded her attack. The two 300-pounders
of the "Affondatore" did much damage on
board the "Kaiser," but the wooden ship's broadside
swept the upper works of the ram as the two vessels
passed each other, and strewed her deck with wreckage.
The fire of the heavy rifled guns on the Italian ironclads
did severe execution on the Austrian wooden ships. The
captain of the "Novara" was killed; the "Erzherzog
Friedrich" and the "Schwarzenberg" were badly hulled,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and leaked so that they were only kept afloat by their
steam pumps. The "Adria" was three times on fire. But
Petz and the wooden division did good service by keeping
the rearward Italian ships fully occupied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tegethoff, standing on the bridge of the
"Ferdinand Max," all reckless of the storm of fire that
roared around him had dashed into the Italian centre.
He rammed first the "Re d'Italia," then the "Palestro,"
but both ships evaded the full force of the blow, and the
Austrian flagship scraped along their sides, bringing down
a lot of gear. The mizzen-topmast and gaff of the
"Palestro" came down with the shock, and the gaff fell
across the Austrian's deck, with the Italian tricolour
flying from it. Before the ships could clear an Austrian
sailor secured the flag. It would seem that the glancing
blow given to the "Re d'Italia" had disorganized her
steering gear, and for a while she was not under control.
Two other ships joined the flagship in attacking her, all
believing she was still Persano's flagship. The "Palestro,"
fighting beside her, was set on fire by shells passing through
her unarmoured stern. The fire made such rapid progress
that she drew out of the fight, her crew trying to save their
ship.</p>

<p>Von Sterneck, the captain of the "Ferdinand Max,"
had gone half-way up the mizzen-rigging, to look out over
the smoke; he reported that the "Re d'Italia" was not
under full control, and Tegethoff once more dashed at his
enemy. The bow of the "Ferdinand Max" this time
struck the "Re d'Italia" full amidships, and simply
forced in her side, making an enormous gap, crushing
and smashing plates and frames. As the "Ferdinand
Max" reversed her engines and drew her bows out of her
adversary's side, the "Re d'Italia" heeled over and sank
instantly, carrying hundreds to the bottom and strewing
the surface with wreckage and struggling men.</p>

<p>The Austrians, after a moment of astonished horror at
their own success, cheered wildly. The "Ferdinand Max"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
tried to save some of the drowning men, and was lowering
her only boat that remained unshattered by the fire,
when the Italian ironclad "Ancona" tried to ram her.
The Austrian flagship evaded the blow, and the "Ancona,"
as she slid past her, almost touching her gun-muzzles,
fired a broadside into her. The powder-smoke from the
Italian guns poured into the port-holes of the "Ferdinand
Max," and for a few moments smothered her gun-deck in
fog, but it was a harmless broadside. In their undisciplined
haste to fire the Italians had loaded only with the cartridge,
there was not a shot in the guns. This tells something
of the confusion on board.</p>

<p>Another Austrian ironclad and two of the gunboats made
plucky efforts to save some of the survivors of the "Re
d'Italia," but they, too, were driven off by the fierce
attacks of Italian ships.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Petz with his wooden ships had fought his
way through the Italian rear. With his old three-decker he
boldly rammed the "Re di Portogallo." The Italian ship
evaded the full force of the blow, but the tall wooden
vessel scraped along her side, starting several of her armour
plates, carrying away port-hole covers and davits, dragging
two anchors from her bows, smashing gun-muzzles and
jerking four light guns into the sea. But the "Kaiser"
herself suffered from the close fire of the "Re di Portogallo's"
heavy guns and the shock of collision. Her
stem and bowsprit were carried away, the gilded crown
of her figure-head falling on her enemy's deck. Her foremast
came crashing down on her funnel, and wrecked it,
and the mass of fallen spars, sails, and rigging was set on
fire by sparks and flame from the damaged funnel, the
collapse of which nearly stopped the draught of the furnaces
and dangerously reduced the pressure on the boilers and
the speed of the engines.</p>

<p>The "Re di Portogallo" sheered off, but her consort, the
"Maria Pia," came rushing down on the disabled "Kaiser."
Petz avoided her ram, and engaged her at close quarters,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
but the shells of the "Maria Pia" burst one of the
"Kaiser's" steam-pipes, temporarily disabled her steering
gear, and did terrible execution in her stern battery. Petz
himself was slightly wounded. With great difficulty he
extricated his ship from the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and cutting away the
wreckage, and fighting the fire that was raging forward,
he steered for San Giorgio, the port of Lissa, to seek shelter
under its batteries. His wooden frigates gallantly protected
his retreat and escorted him to safety, then turned
back to join once more in the fight. This was the moment
when Albini with the Italian wooden squadron might
easily have destroyed Petz's division, but during the day
all he did was to fire a few shots at a range so distant that
they were harmless.</p>

<p>Persano, in the "Affondatore," had for a moment
threatened to attack the "Kaiser," as she struggled out
of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. He steamed towards her, and then suddenly
turned away. He afterwards explained that, seeing the
plight of Petz's flagship, he thought she was already doomed
to destruction, and looked upon it as useless cruelty to
sink her with her crew.</p>

<p>The fleets were now separating, and the fire was slackening.
In this last stage of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e the "Maria Pia" and
the "San Martino" collided amid the smoke, and the
latter received serious injuries. As the fleets worked away
from each other there was still a desultory fire kept up,
but after having lasted for about an hour and a half the
battle was nearly over.</p>

<p>Tegethoff, having got between the Italians and Lissa,
reformed his fleet in three lines of divisions, each in line
ahead, the ironclads to seaward nearest the enemy; the
wooden frigates next; and the gunboats nearest the land.
Every ship except the "Kaiser" (which lay in the entrance
of the port) was still ready for action. Some of them were
leaking badly, including his flagship, which had started
several plates in the bow when she rammed and sank the
"Re d'Italia." The fleet steamed slowly out from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
land on a north-easterly course, the ironclads firing a
few long-ranging shots at the Italians.</p>

<p>Persano was also reforming his fleet in line, and was
flying a signal to continue the action, but he showed no
determined wish to close with Tegethoff again. On the
contrary, while reforming the line he kept it on a northwesterly
course, and thus the distance between the fleets
was increasing every minute, as they were moving on
divergent lines. Gradually the firing died away and the
battle was over. Albini, with the wooden squadron, and
the ironclad "Terribile," which had remained with him,
and taken no part in the fight, ran out and joined the main
fleet.</p>

<p>Persano afterwards explained that he was waiting for
Tegethoff to come out and attack him. But the Austrian
admiral had attained his object, by forcing his way through
the Italian line, and placing himself in a position to co-operate
with the batteries of Lissa, in repelling any further
attempt upon the island. There was no reason why, with
his numerically inferior fleet, he should come out again to
fight a second battle.</p>

<p>But though the action was ended, there was yet another
disaster for the Italians. The "Palestro" had been for
two hours fighting the fire lighted on board of her by the
Austrian shells. Smoke was rising from hatchways and
port-holes, but as she rejoined the fleet she signalled that
the fire was being got under and the magazines had been
drowned. Two of the smaller ships, the "Governolo"
and the "Independenza," came to her help and took off
her wounded. To a suggestion that he should abandon
his ship, her commander, Capellini, replied: "Those who
wish may go, but I shall stay," and his officers and men
remained with him, and continued working to put out
the fire. But the attempt to drown the magazines had
been a failure, for suddenly a deafening explosion thundered
over the sea, the spars of the "Palestro" were seen flying
skyward in a volcano of flame. As the smoke of the explosion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
cleared, the heaving water strewn with debris
showed where the ship had been.</p>

<p>The Austrian fleet was steaming into San Giorgio, amid
the cheers of the garrison and the people, when the explosion
of the "Palestro" took place. Persano drew off with his
fleet into the channel between Lissa and the island of Busi,
and when the sun went down the Italian ships were still in
sight from the look-out stations on the hills of Lissa.</p>

<p>The Austrians worked all night repairing damages, and
preparing for a possible renewal of the fight in the morning.
But at sunrise the look-outs reported that there was not
an Italian ship in sight. Persano had steered for Ancona
after dark, and arrived there on the 21st.</p>

<p>He was so unwise as to report that he had won a great
naval victory in a general engagement with the Austrians
in the waters of Lissa. Italy, already smarting under the
defeat of Custozza, went wild with rejoicing. Cities were
illuminated, salutes were fired, there was a call for high
honours for the victorious admiral. But within forty-eight
hours the truth was known. It was impossible to
conceal the fact that Lissa had been unsuccessfully attacked
for two days, and that on the third it had been
relieved by Tegethoff dashing through the Italian fleet,
and destroying the "Re d'Italia" and the "Palestro,"
without himself losing a single ship. There were riots
in Florence, and the cry was now that Admiral Persano
was a coward and a traitor. To add to the gloom of the
moment the ram "Affondatore," which had been injured
in the battle, sank at her anchors when a sudden gale
swept the roadstead of Ancona.</p>

<p>Three of the twelve Italian ironclads had thus been lost.
Three more were unavailable while their damages were
being slowly repaired. Peace was concluded shortly after,
and the Italian navy had no opportunity of showing what
it could do under a better commander.</p>

<p>In the sinking of the "Re d'Italia" some 450 men had
been drowned. More than 200 lost their lives in the explosion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of the "Palestra," but the other losses of the
Italians in the Battle of Lissa were slight, only 5 killed
and 39 wounded. The Austrians lost 38 killed (including
two captains) and 138 wounded. These losses were not
severe, considering that several wooden ships had been
exposed to heavy shell-fire at close quarters, and one must
conclude that the gunnery of the Italian crews was
wretched. The heaviest loss fell on Petz's flagship, the
"Kaiser," which had 99 killed and wounded. Some of
the gunboats, among which were some old paddle-ships,
though they took part in the fighting, had not a single
casualty.</p>

<p>Persano was tried by court-martial and deprived of his
rank and dismissed from the navy. Tegethoff became the
hero of Austria. His successful attack on a fleet that in
theory should have been able to destroy every one of his
ships in an hour, will remain for all time an honour to the
Austrian navy, and a proof that skill and courage can
hope to reverse the most desperate disadvantages.</p>

<p class="title">
THE BATTLE OF THE YALU<br />
1894</p>


<p>One result of the victory won by Tegethoff at Lissa
was that an exaggerated importance was for many
years to come attached to the ram as a weapon of attack.
In every navy in the world ships were built with bows
specially designed for ramming. The sinking of the "Re
d'Italia" had made such an impression on the public
mind, that it was in vain for a minority among naval
critics to urge that the ram was being overrated, and to
point out that even at Lissa for one successful attempt
to sink an enemy by running her down there had been an
untold number of failures. It was very gradually that
the majority was brought to realize that a ship under full
control could generally avoid a ramming attack, and that
it could only be employed under exceptional circumstances,
and against an already disabled enemy.</p>

<p>Then the progress of invention and armaments introduced
features into naval warfare that made it extremely
difficult and dangerous for a large ship to come to such
close quarters as an attempt to ram implies. First the
introduction of the Whitehead torpedo as part of the
auxiliary armament of battleships and cruisers gave the
ship attacked a means of sinking the aggressor as she
approached, and the increase in the power of guns led
naval tacticians to accept as a principle that fleet actions
must be fought at ranges which were regarded as too
distant for any effective action in earlier days.</p>

<p>But for nearly thirty years after Lissa there were no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
fleet actions. Ships, armour, guns, were all improved,
and the great naval Powers built on a larger and larger
scale. Steel took the place of iron as the material for shipbuilding
and armour. Naval gunnery became a precise
science. Torpedoes were introduced, and with them such
new types of ships as the swift torpedo boat and the
"destroyer." But there was very little fighting on the
sea, though in the same period there were colossal conflicts
on land.</p>

<p>Hundreds of armour-clads were built that became
obsolete, and were turned over to the shipbreaker, without
ever having fired a shot in action. Theories of tactics for
fleet actions were worked out on paper, and tested to
some extent at naval man&#0339;uvres, but the supreme test
of battle was wanting. In the Franco-German War of
1870 the French navy had such a decided superiority
that the few German warships of the day were kept in
their harbours protected by batteries and sunken mines.
The only naval action of the war was an indecisive duel
between two gunboats. In the second stage of the war
the officers and men of the French navy fought as soldiers
in the defence of France. Guns were taken from the ships
to be mounted on land fortifications. Admirals commanded
divisions, formed largely of naval officers and bluejackets.</p>

<p>Again in the war of 1878 between Russia and Turkey
the Russians had only a few light craft in the Black Sea,
and the Turkish fleet under Hobart Pasha, weak as it
was, held the undisputed command of these waters, and
had only to fear some isolated torpedo attacks. In South
American civil wars and international conflicts there
were duels between individual ships, and some dashing
enterprises by torpedo boats, but nothing that could be
described as a fleet action between ironclads. The only
time a British armoured fleet was in action was against
the batteries of Alexandria on the occasion of the bombardment
in July, 1882. The forts, badly armed and constructed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
and inefficiently defended, were silenced, but a
careful examination of them convinced experts that if
they had been held by a better-trained garrison, the victory
would not have been such an easy matter. This and
subsequent experiences have led to the general acceptance
of the view that it will be seldom advisable to risk such
valuable fighting machines as first-class battleships and
armoured cruisers in close action against well-constructed
and powerfully armed shore defences.</p>

<p>It was not till the summer of 1894 that at last there was
another pitched battle between fleets that included a
large proportion of armoured vessels. That action off the
mouth of the Yalu River will be always remembered as
the event that heralded the coming of a new naval power.</p>

<p>A long rivalry between China and Japan for the control
of Korea had resulted in an outbreak of war between the
two empires of the Far East. For an island state like
Japan the command of the sea was a necessary condition
for successful operations on the mainland of Asia, and for
some years she had been building up a powerful fleet, the
ships being constructed in foreign yards, as the Japanese
yards were not yet in a position to turn out large warships.</p>

<p>In the memory of living men the Japanese fleets had
been made up of primitive-looking war-junks. After
failures to build ships in Japan on the European model,
the Government had in the middle of the nineteenth
century purchased some small steamships abroad, but it
was not till 1876 that the first Japanese armour-clad,
the "Fuso," was constructed in England from designs by
the late Sir Edward Reed. Naval progress was at first
very slow, but solid foundations were laid. Young naval
officers were attached to the British and other navies
for professional training, and on their return to Japan
became the educators of their fellow-countrymen in naval
matters. A serious obstacle to the acquisition of a numerous
and powerful fleet was the financial question. Japan is
not a rich country. At first, therefore, the Japanese did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
not venture to order battleships, but contented themselves
with protected cruisers. They thought that these would
be sufficient for the impending conflict with China, which
possessed only a fleet of weak, protected cruisers of various
types and a couple of small coast defence ironclads, that
might be counted as inferior battleships.</p>

<p>When war broke out between China and Japan in 1894,
the fleet of the latter consisted of older ships of miscellaneous
types, and a number of new protected cruisers,
some of them armed with quick-firing guns, a type of
weapon only lately introduced into the world's navies.
Of these modern cruisers most had been built and armed
in French yards, but the best and swiftest ship was a fine
cruiser delivered not long before from Armstrong's yard at
Elswick.</p>

<p>The following lists give some details of the Japanese and
Chinese fleets, only the ships engaged at the Yalu battle
being included. But these ships represented almost the
entire strength of the two rival navies, and no really
effective ship was absent on either side, while to make up
the two squadrons ships were sent to sea that in a European
navy would have been considered obsolete and left in
harbour (see pages <a href="#Page_256">256</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_257">7</a>).</p>

<p>A comparison of these two lists brings out some interesting
points. The advantage in gun power was clearly on
the side of the Japanese. Of the heavier class of guns they
had seventy to fifty-five, and there were no weapons in the
Chinese squadron equal to the long 12&frac12;-inch rifled breech-loaders
of French make, carried by four of the Japanese
cruisers. But there was a further gain in gun power for
the Japanese in the possession of 128 quick-firers, some
of them of fairly heavy calibre. The quick-firing gun was
then a new weapon. It is really a quick loader, a gun
fitted with a breech action that can be opened and closed
by a rapid movement, and so mounted that the recoil is
taken up by mechanism in the carriage which at once
automatically runs the gun back into firing position, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the process of loading is further accelerated (for the smaller
calibre guns) by making up the ammunition like that of a
rifle, with projectile and charge in a big brass-cased cartridge,
so that the gun can be loaded up by one movement,
and the cartridge contains its own means of ignition, and
is fired by pulling off a trigger. The lighter quick-firers are
further mounted on pivots, so that they can be easily
moved through an arc of a circle by one man, who keeps
his eyes on a moving target and his finger on the trigger
ready to fire. The storm of shells that poured from the
Japanese quick-firers was even more terrible for the
Chinese than the slower fire of the heavy guns, and of
these new quick-firing guns the Chinese only had three on
the little "Kwang-ping."</p>

<p>The Chinese fleet had more armour protection. The
two coast-defence battleships were heavily armoured, and
there were three other less completely protected ironclads,
although seven other ships had no armour whatever. In
the Japanese fleet the only armoured vessels were the two
old ironclads, belonging to an obsolete type, and the
armour-belted "Chiyoda." The real fighting force of the
fleet was made up of the seven new protected cruisers.
Some of these had armour on the barbettes in which their
long bow-guns were mounted, but their "protection"
consisted in a deck plated with steel covering the "vitals"
of the ship, boilers, engines, and magazines, all placed as
low as possible in the hull. There was some further protection
afforded by the coal-bunkers placed along the water-line
amidships. The theory of the protected cruiser was
that everything below the water-line was safeguarded by
this armoured deck, and as the over-water portion of the
ship was further divided by bulk-heads into numerous
water-tight compartments, the danger of the ship being
sunk was remote. The protected cruiser is no longer regarded
as having a place in the main fighting-line. But the
Japanese cruisers gave such good results in the Yalu battle
that for a while an exaggerated value was attached to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>But in one point, and the most important of all, the
Japanese had an overwhelming advantage. The Chinese
officers and men were mostly brave enough, but almost
entirely unskilled. The only really efficient officers and
engineers they had were a few Englishmen and Americans
and two Germans. The Japanese, from Admiral Count Ito,
who commanded, down to the youngest of the bluejackets,
were not only brave with the inherited recklessness of
death and suffering, which is characteristic of their race,
but were also highly trained in every branch of their
profession, first-rate sailors, excellent gunners. And the
fleet had for years been exercised in man&#0339;uvres, so that
the ships could work together as an organized whole. The
spirit which animated it was that of "No surrender&mdash;Victory
at any cost." It is a standing order of the Japanese
navy that if a ship should strike her colours, the first duty
of her consorts is not to try to recapture her, but to endeavour
to sink her and her crew.</p>

<p>The Mandarin Ting, who commanded the Chinese fleet,
was more of a soldier than a sailor, but he had some sea
experience, and was a thoroughly brave man. As soon as
war was declared he was anxious to go in search of his
enemy. He urged upon the Pekin Government that the
first step to be taken was to use the Chinese fleet to attack
the Japanese transports, which were conveying troops to
Korea. This would, of course, lead to a battle with the
enemy's fleet, but Ting was quite confident that he would
defeat the Japanese if he met them. In giving this advice
the Chinese admiral was reasoning on correct principles,
even if his confidence in his own fighting power was not
justified by facts. To keep the fleet idle at Port Arthur or
Wei-hai-wei would be to concede the command of the sea
to Japan, without an effort to dispute it.</p>

<p>But the mandarins at Pekin would not accept their
admiral's view. In the first place they were alarmed at
the fact that in a minor naval engagement off the Korean
coast, at the very outset of the conflict, the weak Chinese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
force in action had fared very badly. The quarrel in
Korea had begun without a regular declaration of war.
On the coast there were the Chinese cruiser, "Tsi-yuen,"
and a small gunboat, the "Kwang-yi." On 24 July the
two ships had gone to sea to look for, and give their escort
to, some transports that were expected with reinforcements
from China. In the grey of the morning on the 25th
they fell in with, and were attacked by, three of the swift
protected cruisers of the Japanese fleet, the "Yoshino,"
"Akitsushima," and "Naniwa Kan." The fight was soon
over. The gunboat was sunk, and the little cruiser was
attacked at close quarters by the "Naniwa Kan," whose
shells riddled her weak conning-tower, killing all within
it. The "Tsing Yuen" fled, pursued by the "Naniwa,"
whose commander, by the way, was Captain Togo, famous
afterwards as the victorious admiral of the Russo-Japanese
War. The "Tsing Yuen" made good her escape, only because
the chase brought the "Naniwa Kan" on the track
of the transport "Kowshing," and Togo stopped to dispose
of her by sending her to the bottom.</p>

<p>This incident made the Pekin Government nervous
about the fighting qualities of their ships. And then they
were afraid that if Ting went to sea with all his ships, the
Japanese fleet would elude him, and appear with an expeditionary
force at the mouth of the Pei-ho, capture the
Taku forts, and land an army to march on Pekin. They
therefore ordered Admiral Ting to collect his fleet at Port
Arthur, and watch the sea-approach to the capital.</p>

<p>The Japanese were therefore able to land their troops in
Korea without interruption, and soon overran the peninsula.
When they were advancing to capture Ping-yang,
the Chinese began to concentrate a second army to defend
the crossing of the Yalu River, the entrance into Southern
Manchuria. It was now evident even to the Pekin mandarins
that the Japanese plans did not at this stage of the
war include a raid on the Pei-ho and the Chinese capital,
so Admiral Ting was at last allowed to go to sea, in order
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to protect the movement of transports along the western
shores of the Korean Bay to the mouth of the Yalu.</p>

<p>On 14 September five large steamers crowded with
troops left Taku under the convoy of six Chinese cruisers
and four torpedo boats, bound for the mouth of the Yalu
River. Next day, as they passed Talienwan Bay, near
Port Arthur, they were joined by Ting with the rest of the
fleet. On the second day they safely reached their destination,
and the troops were disembarked. And early on the
17th Ting again put to sea with his fleet to return to Port
Arthur.</p>

<p>He had expected to have to fight the Japanese on his
outward voyage, and he knew that there was a still greater
chance of meeting them on his way back down the bay.
He had a few white officers with him. On board his flagship,
the armour-clad "Ting-yuen" was a German
artillery officer, Major von Hanneken. On the other
battleship was Commander McGiffen, formerly of the
United States navy, nominally second in command to the
Chinese captain of the "Chen-yuen," but practically
acting as her commander. On some of the other ships there
were a few British-born engineer or gunnery officers, and
some of the latter had been petty officers in the English
navy. By the advice of these non-Chinese officers Ting
had done something to remedy the defects of his fleet.</p>

<p>A good deal of woodwork had been cut away and thrown
overboard, though far too much of it still remained, and
on several ships there was a dangerous quantity of carved
ornamental wood on the upper works, much of it all the
more inflammable because it was gilded and lacquered in
bright colours which it was the practice to clean with
oiled rags. The thin steel roofs of barbettes, and the
shields of many of the guns, had been removed, as the
"Tsi-yuen's" experiences in the fight with the "Naniwa
Kan" had shown that such light steel did not keep out
the shells of the Japanese quick-firers, but served only to
ensure their bursting with deadly effect. Sometimes a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
gun-shield had burst a shell, which if there had been no
such attempt at protection would perhaps have passed
harmlessly over the heads of the gunners. Round the
barbettes of the ships sacks of coal were stacked as an
emergency method of strengthening these defences. Of
coal the fleet had an abundance, but it was woefully short
of ammunition, and much of what was on board was old
and defective. If Ting had had more professional knowledge
and training, he would have been more anxious as to
the probable result of a battle.</p>

<p>Where were Admiral Ito and the Japanese fleet? Early
in August he had crossed the Yellow Sea with his cruiser
squadron, and shown himself before Port Arthur and
Wei-hai-Wei. He drew the fire of the seaward forts at long
range, and replied with a few shots, but he made no attack.
He was engaged only in a reconnaissance, and was quite
satisfied when he ascertained that the Chinese ships were
remaining in harbour. He then returned to the Korean
side of the Yellow Sea, and till nearly the middle of September
was employed in escorting the convoys of transports
from Japan, and protecting the disembarkation of the reinforcements
they were bringing to Korea.</p>

<p>On Friday, 14 September&mdash;the same day on which the
Chinese convoy with the reinforcements for Manchuria
left Taku&mdash;Ito had completed his work in connection with
the transport of Japanese troops, having landed the last
detachments at Chinampo in the estuary of the Ta-tung
River. Higher up the river General Nodzu's army was
attacking the Chinese walled town of Ping-yang. Ito sent
his gunboats up the Ta-tung to co-operate with Nodzu,
and leaving his torpedo boats at the river mouth, went to
sea with his fleet. He steered for the mouth of the Yalu
River, intending to reconnoitre the Chinese positions
there, and obtain information as to the reported concentration
of troops near the river mouth, but under the
belief that the enemy's fleet was still at Port Arthur,
Admiral Ting was just as ignorant of his enemy's position
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and movements. Early on the morning of Monday,
17 September, he had expended some ammunition in
practice at floating targets off the mouth of the Yalu.
The fleet had then anchored, and the men were given a
rest while the cooks got dinner ready. This was about
11 a.m. A little later there was unexpected news, that
interrupted the cooking. The look-outs at the mastheads
of the anchored fleet reported that the smoke of many
steamers was rising above the horizon far away to the
south-westward. It was a bright sunny day, with a
perfectly smooth sea, clear air, and a blue sky, and the
look-out men could easily make out that the smoke rising
above the skyline came from a long line of funnels. Admiral
Ting had no doubt it was the Japanese fleet, and he
gave orders to weigh anchor and clear for action.</p>

<p>Early that morning Admiral Ito had heard from coasting
craft that the Chinese fleet was at sea, and one trader
retailed to him a rumour that the fleet was anchored
behind Hai-Yang island, where there was a sheltered
roadstead. But on reaching Hai-Yang he found only a
few fishing-boats lying behind the island. He continued
his voyage towards the Yalu, now anticipating a meeting
with Ting, unless the Chinese admiral had already run
down the other coast of the bay, and so passed him at a
distance during the previous night.</p>

<p>Ito's fleet was steaming in line ahead, and was organized
in two squadrons. The van squadron was led by his
second in command, Admiral Tsuboi, who had hoisted
his flag on the fast cruiser "Yoshino." After her in succession
came the cruisers "Takachico," "Akitsushima,"
and "Naniwa Kan." Then there was a considerable interval
between the van squadron and the leading ship of
the main squadron, the cruiser "Matsushima," flying
Count Ito's flag. Next to her came the armoured cruiser
"Chiyoda"; then the "Matsushima's" two sister ships,
the cruisers "Ikitsushima" and "Hashidate." The four
ships of the van squadron and the four leading ships
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of the main squadron represented the chief strength of
Ito's fleet, his eight modern cruisers. After them came
the two old ironclads "Hiyei" and "Fuso," the gunboat
"Akagi," and the small armed merchant steamer "Saikio
Maru." The long line of warships steaming swiftly through
the sunlight must have looked more like a fleet arrayed
for some festive occasion than squadrons prepared for
imminent battle, for every ship was painted a brilliant
white, with the gilded device of the chrysanthemum forming
a broad golden shield on her bows, and the red-and-white
sun flag of Japan flew from every masthead.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven, half an hour after the Chinese had
perceived the approach of the Japanese fleet, the
"Yoshino," which was leading the advancing line of the
van squadron, signalled that there was a dense mass of
black smoke on the horizon inshore. This was the smoke
produced by Ting's furnaces, as his ships hurriedly stoked
their fires to get full pressure on the boilers. Then the
Chinese fleet was seen coming out and forming in line of
battle.</p>

<p>Admiral Ting formed his ships in line abreast, that is
side by side with every bow towards the enemy. In the
centre were the two little battleships, with the armoured
cruisers, "Lai-yuen" and "King-yuen," to right and left
of them. On each flank of these four heavy ships there
was a group of three unarmoured cruisers&mdash;the "Ching-yuen,"
"Chao-yung," and "Yang-wei"&mdash;on the right;
and the "Chi-yuen," "Kwang-chia," and "Tsi-yuen," on
the left. These were the ten ships on which he relied to
bear the brunt of the fighting. Away to the left flank and
rear of the line, and nearer the shore, was the small, armour-clad
"Ping-yuen," the corvette "Kwang-ping," and four
torpedo boats. The Chinese fleet was under easy steam.
The ships were painted a dull black, but had a large amount
of gilding and colour on their bows, upper works, and deck-houses,
and they were all dressed with flags. The decks
had been strewn with sand, to prevent accidents by men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
slipping, and flooded with water from the fire hose to
minimize the danger of fire.</p>

<p>The fleets were now rapidly closing. McGiffen, the
American officer of the "Chen-yuen," was impressed with
the "holiday aspect" of the scene. "The twenty-two
ships," he wrote in an account of the battle, "trim and
fresh in their paint and their bright new bunting, and gay
with fluttering signal flags, presented such a holiday
aspect, that one found a difficulty in realizing that they
were not there simply for a friendly meeting."</p>

<p>When the range of the leading Japanese ship&mdash;the
"Yoshino"&mdash;was just 5400 metres, or something less than
3&frac12; miles, the Chinese admiral fired one of his heavy barbette
guns at her from the "Ting-yuen." The shot fell
short, throwing up a great fountain of foaming water.
The guns of the other Chinese ships roared out, and the
line was wrapped in smoke, but the gunners had not the
range in most cases, and their shooting was everywhere
bad. Untouched by the hostile fire, the Japanese fleet
came silently on.</p>

<p>At first the Japanese line had been heading directly for
the Chinese centre. It now altered its course, ship after
ship, the "Yoshino" leading the line so that it would
pass obliquely across the right front of the enemy, and
beyond the extreme right of his line, the wing of Ting's
fleet that was furthest from the shore. At a range of
about two miles, the "Yoshino" began replying to the
Chinese fire with her bow guns and her starboard battery,
and the other ships opened as they reached the same range.
Thanks to McGiffen's narrative, we know what was the
impression made on the few skilled observers in the Chinese
fleet. The advancing line of hostile cruisers was wrapped
in a dense cloud of smoke, out of which rose their tall
masts. Through the smoke came a continual flicker of the
long red flashes of the Japanese quick-firers. To men used
to the old guns the rapidity of the fire was something
startling. But the Japanese had just missed getting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
range. The showers of shells were falling ahead of the
Chinese ships. The sea in front of their bows was a mass
of spurting columns and fountains of foam, and some of
these geysers of sea-water shot up so close ahead that they
splashed over the Chinese ships, and numbers of men on
their forward-decks were drenched to the skin.</p>

<p>But as the range shortened the rain of shells began to
find its target, and fell crashing and exploding on the
hulls and upper-works of the Chinese line. It had now
lost something of its first formation. The centre had
surged forward, the wings had hung back, and it had
become slightly convex. Ito in his report stated that
Admiral Ting had adopted a crescent formation, but this
was only the result of his ships not keeping station correctly.
His order had been to fight in "line abreast."
Presently the line became so irregular that some of the
Chinese ships were masking each other's fire. The slow
fire of the Chinese guns, ill directed as it was, did little
damage to the Japanese cruisers. But the Chinese ships
were already suffering from the shower of shells. The
Japanese found themselves faced with an unexpected
difficulty of detail. In the older type of guns the silk
cartridge-case was burned when the shot was fired. But
with the quick-firers the solid drawn brass case of the
cartridge, a thing like a big metal can, is jerked out by an
extractor as the breech-block is swung back after firing,
and these brass cases began to accumulate in heaps at
the gun positions. Extra men were sent to the batteries
to throw them overboard.</p>

<p>The "Yoshino" was now on the extreme flank of
Ting's right, about a mile away from the "Yang-wei."
Count Ito signalled from the "Matsushima" for the van
squadron to circle round the enemy's fleet by changing
its course to starboard. This would bring the weaker
ships of the hostile squadron under a cross-fire from the
van squadron, sweeping round astern of them, and the
main squadron crossing their bows obliquely. At the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
time the ships on the Chinese left had most of their guns
masked by their consorts, and could only fire at relatively
long range with their bow guns at the rearward ships of
the Japanese main squadron. Ting was out-generalled,
and was paying the penalty of a bad formation. His weak
right wing was in imminent danger of being crushed by
superior numbers and weight of fire.</p>

<p>The two ironclads in the Chinese centre had been made
the target of the heaviest guns in Ito's fleet. Theoretically
these guns should have been able to pierce even the heavily
armoured plating of the barbettes, but no projectile
penetrated the armour of the two ships, though shot
after shot came thundering against them. Their unarmoured
parts were pierced again and again, the shells
bursting as they entered, and lighting several fires that
were extinguished with difficulty.</p>

<p>But the unarmoured ships on the Chinese right were
suffering terribly under the cross-fire of the enemy's van
and main squadrons. The two outer ships on this flank
were the "Chao Yung" and the "Yang-wei." Each of
these ships had a barbette armed with a 10-inch gun fore
and aft. Amidships was a raised structure carrying
machine guns on its roof, and having on each side of it
a passage, off which opened a range of wooden cabins, oil-painted
and varnished. Under the rain of bursting shells
these masses of dry, inflammable woodwork were soon
ablaze; the fire spreading rapidly made it impossible to
bring up ammunition for the guns, and the two cruisers
drifted helplessly out of the line, each wrapped in clouds
of black smoke, through which long tongues of red flame
shot up into the air.</p>

<p>On the other flank practically no damage had been done
by the few shots fired by the Japanese in this direction.
But here there was a miserable display of cowardice on the
part of the Chinese. The ship on the extreme left was the
"Tsi-yuen," which still bore the marks of her encounter
with the "Naniwa Kan," in the first days of the war.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
The experiences of that adventure had evidently got on
the nerves of Captain Fong, who commanded her. As the
Japanese line swung round the other flank, he suddenly
left his station and steamed at full speed away from his
admiral, crossing astern of the Japanese, at what he
thought a safe distance, and heading for Port Arthur.
The rearmost Japanese cruiser, the "Chiyoda," sent a
shell after him, that dismounted one of his guns, and added
wings to his flight. The "Kwang-chia," the next ship in
the Chinese line, followed his bad example, and leaving
the battle raging behind them, the two cruisers soon disappeared
over the south-western horizon. Fong, with the
"Tsi-yuen," reached Port Arthur. He said he had been
in the thick of the fight, and only left it when the day was
lost. But the evidence of his own crew was against him.
He was promptly tried by court-martial and beheaded.
The other ship, the "Kwang-chia," never reached Port
Arthur. She was wrecked during the night after the
battle, with much loss of life, on a reef outside Talienwan
Bay.</p>

<p>There were some other instances of half-heartedness or
worse among the Chinese as the fight developed, but on the
whole they fought bravely, and many showed the most
self-sacrificing courage.</p>

<p>While the large Japanese cruisers of the two squadrons
kept perfect station and distance, and enveloped the
Chinese right wing with as much precision as if they had
been carrying out a fleet exercise in peace man&#0339;uvres, the
older ships in their line, less speedy and handy, had dropped
astern, and were under fire from Ting's two ironclads in
the centre. The "Fuso" was at one time so close to
them that one of the ironclads made an attempt to ram her,
but the Japanese ship evaded it, and running along the
broken front of the enemy, rejoined the main cruiser
squadron. The other of the old Japanese ironclads, the
"Hiyei," boldly steamed between the Chinese battleships,
amid a storm of fire. Two torpedoes were discharged at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
her, but both missed, and she joined the van squadron in
the Chinese rear. The little "Akagi" was for a while
the target of many of the Chinese guns, and one of her
masts went over the side. Ito had signalled to her, and
to the armed merchantman, "Saikio Maru," that they
might keep out of the fight, but Japanese courage would
not allow of this. The "Saikio Maru" had a narrow
escape. As the two burning cruisers drifted away from
the Chinese right, making for the Yalu, the "Saikio"
pursued them, firing her light guns. Two Chinese gunboats
opened upon her and four torpedo boats steamed out to
attack her. But she turned her fire on them, and some of
the Japanese cruisers helped her by accurate shooting at
long range. The Chinese flotilla, which had expected an
easy prey, turned back, and gunboats and torpedo boats
disappeared in the Yalu estuary.</p>

<p>But in the brief encounter the "Saikio Maru" had
received a good deal of damage from the light guns of the
hostile flotilla. Her funnel was riddled, and several steam-pipes
cut through. She retired from the engagement.
With her went the "Hiyei," which had been seriously
damaged in her dash through the Chinese centre. The
"Akagi" also withdrew to clear her decks, which were
encumbered with wreckage. The fall of her mast had killed
her captain, Sakamoto, and her two lieutenants were
badly wounded.</p>

<p>So far Ting had lost four of his unarmoured cruisers, and
Ito had sent out of the fight three of his ships, the old
ironclad "Hiyei," the gunboat "Akagi," and the armed
steamer "Saikio Maru." But none of these were fighting
units of serious value. His two squadrons of protected
cruisers were intact, and it was on these he counted for
victory.</p>

<p>The second phase of the battle was a prolonged cannonade
at a range of from one to two miles. Thanks to the superior
speed of the Japanese fleet, Ito could choose position and
distance, and the training of his officers and men enabled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
him to concentrate his fire now on one part, now on another,
of the straggling Chinese line. His ships poured out a
steady shower of shells, whose heavy bursting charges not
only scattered hurtling fragments of steel among the
Chinese crews, but also had a tendency to light a hot fire
wherever they exploded. The Chinese had a very poor
supply of inferior ammunition, most of it armour-piercing
projectiles, that were practically solid shot. Their fire
was slow and ill-directed, and even when it found its target
the damage done was seldom serious.</p>

<p>Two more Chinese ships were soon disposed of. The
cruiser "Chi-yuen" had been pluckily fought by her
Chinese captain, Tang, and her English engineer, Purvis.
She had received several shots between wind and water,
and was leaking badly. Tang knew she could not be long
kept afloat, and he made a desperate resolution to attempt
to ram a Japanese ship before he went down. As the
enemy's van squadron, headed by the "Yoshino," came
sweeping to closer range with the Chinese left the "Chi-yuen"
made a dash for the leading cruiser. Even if she
had not been half-sinking already, the Chinese ship had
neither the speed nor handiness to ram the swiftest ship
in the enemy's line. As the "Chi-yuen" came on, the
guns of the van squadron were concentrated on her. She
was enveloped in a fierce storm of bursting shells, and
suddenly her bows plunged in the sea, her twin screws
whizzed for a moment in the air, and then all that was
left to show where she had sunk was floating wreckage and
drowning men. Purvis went down with his ship. Tang
was seen swimming on an oar for a few minutes, with a
big dog&mdash;a pet of his&mdash;paddling near him. Then the dog
put its paws on his shoulders, and he was forced under
and drowned.</p>

<p>Another Chinese cruiser, the "Lai-yuen," which lay in
the line to the right of the two armour-clads, was now
seen to be burning fiercely. On board this ship the Chinese
engine-room staff showed devoted courage. While the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
fire spread through the upper works, so that after the
fight many of the iron deck beams were bare and twisted
out of shape, not one of the brave men below quitted his
post. Stokers, engineers, mechanics worked almost naked,
in heat like that of a furnace. Some died, all were in the
doctor's hands after the fight, but they kept the engines
going, obeyed orders, and brought the half-burnt ship out
of action.</p>

<p>More than half of the Chinese fleet had now been destroyed
or beaten off, without any loss to the main fighting
force of the Japanese. Disregarding the Chinese cruisers,
which were now badly cut up and firing harmlessly at
long range, Ito concentrated his attack on the two armour-clads.
Though each ship was hit more than four hundred
times, their armour was never pierced. Yet the Japanese
had some guns that theoretically should have penetrated
it. Battle results are, however, often very different from
experimental work on the testing range.</p>

<p>Early in the fight a Japanese shell had cut down the
foremast of the Chinese flagship, sending overboard and
drowning seven men who manned the top&mdash;carrying away
also the signal yards, so that no orders could for some time
be conveyed to the fleet. But for more than an hour
Admiral Ting was in no condition to give orders. Almost
at the outset he had carelessly taken a position that brought
him within the danger arc of the blast from his own big
barbette guns. He was stunned, and for a while it was
thought that he was dead. The ship was fought by two
European officers, Herr Albrecht, a German, and Mr.
Nicholls, who had formerly been a petty officer in the
British navy. Albrecht distinguished himself by more
than once going to terribly exposed positions, and personally
handling the hose with which he extinguished the
fires lighted by the Japanese shells. Nicholls directed the
barbette guns with a cool courage worthy of the service
in which he had been trained, until he was killed by a
bursting shell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>Two other white men, the German soldier, Captain von
Hanneken, and the American commander, McGiffen, took
a prominent part in the fighting on board the other armour-clad,
the "Chen-yuen." Both had more than one narrow
escape. Von Hanneken was stunned for a while by an
explosion, and slightly wounded while at the barbette
guns. When the lacquered woodwork of the bow burst
into flame and smoke, and none of the Chinese would go
forward to extinguish it, McGiffen, who was in command of
the ship, dragged the fire-hose to the danger point. Just
as he had drowned the fire he was wounded in two places
and stunned by a bursting shell. He had told the men in
the barbette not to reopen fire till he rejoined them, but, to
his horror, as he recovered from the shock he saw the guns
swing round and point directly over the bow. He escaped
being blown to pieces by dropping through an open hatchway.
Altogether during the fight the "Chen-yuen" was
on fire eight times.</p>

<p>Most of the Chinese crew fought pluckily, but there were
some skulkers. McGiffen tells how once, when there was
something wrong with the revolving gear of the barbette
guns, and he went down into a recess under the barbette
to clear it, he saw a group of frightened men huddled in
the semi-darkness, and heard the voice of a Chinese
officer saying: "You can't hide down here. There are
too many of us already." But he tells also of the courage
of others. The captain of one of the guns was killed as
he prepared to fire, the man's head being shattered by a
shell, and his brains scattered over the gun. Another
man dragged the corpse away, took the lanyard, looked
along the sights, and fired without a moment's hesitation.
Tsao-kai, the gunnery lieutenant, was badly wounded and
taken below. He had brought his brother, a mere boy, on
board for a holiday, and had him beside him in the
barbette. The boy remained there to the end, helping
to pass up ammunition, and apparently regarding the
fight as an interesting game, though he was the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
unwounded individual in the barbette when the battle
ended.</p>

<p>McGiffen asserts that when the fight began the "Chen-yuen"
had in her magazine, besides a quantity of armour-piercing
(almost solid) shot, only three really effective
shells for the 12-inch guns. Two of these were fired early
in the day. In the afternoon, in handling the ammunition,
a third was discovered. It was fired at the "Matsushima,"
Ito's flagship, and did terrible execution. Ito, in his
report, says that the incident occurred at 3.26 p.m., and
that the shell came from the "Ting-yuen," but this
appears to have been a mistake. The shell dismounted
a 5-inch gun, seriously damaged two more, and exploded
a quantity of quick-firing ammunition that was lying
ready near the guns. According to the Japanese official
report, forty-six men were killed or badly wounded. Unofficial
narratives make the loss even greater. One officer
was simply blown to pieces. The flame of the explosion
set the ship on fire, and she was for a while in imminent
danger of destruction.</p>

<p>"The crew," writes Mr. H. W. Wilson, "with unabated
gallantry and courage, divided their attention between
the fire and the enemy. The bandsmen went to the guns,
and, though the position of the ship was critical, and her
loss appalling, there was no panic. The fire was on the
lower deck, just above the magazine. In charge of the
magazine were a gunner's mate and a seaman. The shell
had apparently dented the plating over the powder, and
the red glow through the crevices showed the danger.
But these brave men did not abandon their post. Stripping
off their clothes, they crammed them into the cracks, and
saved the 'Matsushima'; though nearly a third of the
men above the waterline had been put out of action, the
remnant got the fire under."</p>

<p>While the fire was still burning the "Matsushima"
steamed out of the fight, and Ito transferred his flag to
the cruiser "Hashidate." This was really the second
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
narrow escape the "Matsushima" had experienced during
the battle. Early in the fight a 10-inch shell had passed
through her side, killed four men in her torpedo-room,
narrowly missed a loaded torpedo, smashed up an oil-tank,
and then broke into pieces. Examination of the fragments
showed there was no trace of a fuse, and a plug of cement
filled the place where the bursting charge should have
been. It was really a bad specimen of a solid shot. If it
had been a live shell, it might well have destroyed the
"Matsushima." It was thanks to the wretched ammunition
supplied by swindling contractors to the mandarins
that the Japanese were able to fight the battle
with such trifling loss.</p>

<p>After the transfer of Ito's flag to the "Hashidate" the
battle became a cannonade at an increasing range. The
Chinese ammunition was running low, and Ito, after having
had his quick-firers in action for hours, had also his magazines
nearly empty. The heavy fire of the afternoon had
failed to destroy the two little "battleships" that represented
the only remaining effective units of the Chinese
fleet. Ito had accomplished enough in the destruction of
the Chinese cruisers, and he had no intention of giving
their torpedo boats a chance, by spending the night near
the mouth of the Yalu River. At half-past five he broke
off the engagement.</p>

<p>Shortness of ammunition supply and exhaustion of
officers and men were probably his real reasons, for the
explanation he gave in his official report is not very convincing.
"About 5.30 p.m.," he writes, "seeing that the
'Chen-yuen' and the 'Ting-yuen' had been joined by
other ships, and that my van squadron was separated by
a great distance from my main force, and considering that
sunset was approaching, I discontinued the action, and
recalled my main squadron by signal. As the enemy's
vessels proceeded on a southerly course, I assumed that
they were making for Wei-hai-wei; and having reassembled
the fleet, I proceeded upon what I supposed to be a parallel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
course to that of the enemy, with the intention of renewing
the engagement in the morning, for I judged that a night
action might be disadvantageous, owing to the possibility
of the ships becoming separated in the darkness,
and to the fact that the enemy had torpedo boats in company.
However, I lost sight of the Chinese, and at daylight
there were no signs of the enemy."</p>

<p>There really were no ships of any importance available
to join the Chinese ironclads, so one is puzzled to imagine
what Ito saw. It was only when the firing died away that
Admiral Ting sent orders to the "Kwang-ping," the
transports, gunboats, and torpedo craft to come out.
Only the "Kwang-ping" and the torpedo boats obeyed.
As the sun went down he formed line ahead, and steered for
Port Arthur. First came the two ironclads; then the
"Lai-yuen," with her upper works still on fire in places;
then the "Ching-yuen," "Ping-yuen," "Kwang-ping,"
and the torpedo boats. Far astern the abandoned "Chao-yung"
blazed like a bonfire in the twilight. Ting honestly
believed he had beaten off the Japanese fleet, and on his
arrival at Port Arthur reported a victory. But though
Japanese opinion was not quite satisfied, Ito had so
damaged the Chinese fleet that henceforth he held command
of the sea. He had won his success with comparatively
small loss. Of all the units of his fleet his flagship,
the "Matsushima," had suffered most. She had two
officers killed and three wounded, and 33 men killed and
71 wounded, a total of 109, and about a third of the
losses in the entire fleet. The "Hiyei" came next in
the casualty list, with 56 killed and wounded. The
losses of the other ships were trifling. The "Ikitsushima"
had 31 killed and wounded; the "Akagi," 28; the
"Akitsushima," 15; the "Fuso," 14; and the "Yoshino"
and "Saikio," each 11. The "Takachico" had an officer
and two men wounded; the "Naniwa Kan" (Captain
Togo's ship) one man wounded. The "Chiyoda," which
lay next to the "Matsushima," in the main squadron,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
had not one single casualty. The official return of losses
gave these totals:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are no available returns of the Chinese loss. It
was certainly much heavier, perhaps a thousand men. But,
thanks to their armour, the two "battleships" suffered
comparatively little loss, notwithstanding the terrible
fire to which they were exposed for hours. The "Ting-yuen"
had 14 killed and 20 wounded, the "Chen-yuen"
7 killed and 15 wounded. The two ships afterwards took
part in the defence of Wei-hai-wei, where one was torpedoed
and the other captured by the Japanese.</p>

<p>When the first reports of the Yalu battle reached Europe
there was much exaggerated talk about the value of the
protected cruiser. It was even said by amateur "naval
experts" that this type and not the battleship would be
the warship of the future. It is almost needless to say
that the battle conveyed no such lesson. If anything, it
rather proved the enormous resisting power of the armoured
ship. If Ting, instead of his two antiquated coast-defence
armour-clads, had had a couple of up-to-date
battleships manned with trained crews, he would certainly
have disposed of a good many of the Japanese cruisers.
The Japanese quite realized this, and proceeded to build
a heavily armoured fleet.</p>

<p>The most valuable lesson of the battle was the warning
of the danger of fires lighted by exploding shells. This
had an immediate influence on ship construction, and on
the methods adopted by all navies in clearing for action.</p>

<p>But the most important point of all was that the conduct
of the Japanese officers and men in the battle, and in the
subsequent naval operations in the siege of Wei-hai-wei,
made the world realize that a new naval power had arisen
in the Far East.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="title">
SANTIAGO DE CUBA<br />
1898</p>


<p>The United States Navy had taken a decisive part in
securing victory for the Union in the War of Secession.
It had effectively blockaded the Atlantic and Gulf
coasts of the Confederacy, captured New Orleans, given
valuable help to the army, in seizing the line of the Mississippi,
and by the combined effect of these operations
isolated the Confederate States from the rest of the world,
destroyed their trade, and cut off their supplies.</p>

<p>One would have expected that the importance of sea-power
would have been fully appreciated in the United
States after such experiences, and that steps would have
been taken to form and maintain an effective fleet. But
for some twenty years after the war the American Navy
was hopelessly neglected. During this period the fleet
consisted mainly of some of the miscellaneous collection
of ships of various types built or purchased during the
years of conflict. Old monitors that had engaged the
batteries of Charleston figured in the Navy List, beside
sloops and steam frigates that were little better than
armed merchantmen. The only good work that was
done by the Navy Department was the training and maintenance
of a corps of excellent officers, and to their influence
it was due that at last a beginning was made of the
building of a new navy.</p>

<p>The first ships built were of two classes. Public opinion
was still clinging to the idea that the "Monitor" was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
supremely effective type of warship, and accordingly considerable
sums were expended on the building of coast-defence
vessels of this type, low-freeboard turret-ships,
carrying a couple of heavy guns in an armoured turret.
But ships were also required that could make ocean
voyages, and show the flag in foreign waters, and for this
purpose a number of protected cruisers were built, full-rigged,
masted steamers, with their guns in broadside
batteries.</p>

<p>Still, the United States possessed only a fourth or fifth-rate
fleet, and could not have sent to sea a squadron that
could rank with the fleets kept in commission regularly by
several of the European powers. Advocates of the old
American plan of "having no foreign policy" even maintained
that the country had no need of an ocean-going
fleet, and required only coast-defence ships and a few
light cruisers.</p>

<p>It was not till the end of the 'eighties that American
opinion was aroused to the danger of neglecting the sea-power
of the States. The splendid American Navy of
to-day is the creation of less than twenty years of systematic
development. When the war broke out between the
United States and Spain over the Cuban question several
of the new cruisers and battleships were available, but
many older ships were still in the service, and a number
of armed liners and other makeshift auxiliaries were taken
into the navy.</p>

<p>During the period of tension that immediately preceded
the war two fleets were concentrated on the Atlantic coast.
The North Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Sampson, at Key
West, Florida, and the reserve fleet, officially known as the
"Flying Squadron," under Commodore Schley, at Hampton
Roads. The Pacific Squadron, under Commodore Dewey,
was at Hong Kong, waiting to sail for the Philippines as
soon as war was declared.</p>

<p>In the following list of Sampson's and Schley's squadrons,
besides the displacement of each ship, the date of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
launch is noted, so as to distinguish between the older and
the newer types of warships:&mdash;</p>

<p>These were the two fleets available for the blockade of
Cuba, and the operations of attacking coast fortifications,
covering the transportation of the army of invasion, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
dealing with any naval force Spain might send to these
waters.</p>

<p>Other units were subsequently added to the fleet after
both squadrons had concentrated under Sampson's command.</p>

<p>In West Indian waters the Spaniards had only a few
light craft and the old cruiser "Reina Mercedes" at
Santiago, with her boilers and engines in such a state
that she could not go to sea. For many years the Spanish
Navy had been sadly neglected, but since 1890 some
armoured cruisers had been built, and a flotilla of torpedo-boat
destroyers added to the navy. A number of antiquated
units figured on the Navy List, including useless
"battleships" dating from the 'sixties, and small unarmoured
cruisers little better than gunboats. There was
one fairly modern battleship, the "Pelayo," dating from
1887, but expert opinion was very divided about her
value.</p>

<p>When the war broke out the Spanish Pacific Squadron,
under Admiral Montojo, was at Manila. To use the words
of an American naval officer, it was made up of "a number
of old tubs not fit to be called warships." It was promptly
destroyed by Commodore Dewey's squadron from Hong
Kong (Battle of Manila Bay, Sunday, 1 May, 1898). It
was the first American victory in the war, and in the
national rejoicing there was much exaggeration as to
Dewey's exploit, which was compared to Nelson's
victories!</p>

<p>On the eve of the war a Spanish fleet, officially known as
the Atlantic Squadron, had been concentrated, under the
command of Admiral Cervera, in the Portuguese harbour
of St. Vincent, in the Cape de Verde Islands, and the
local authorities somewhat strained the laws of neutrality
by allowing Cervera to use the port to complete
his preparations for some time after the outbreak of the
war.</p>

<p>The armoured cruisers were all of the same type, ships
with an armoured deck under water protecting the engines
and magazines, a 6-inch armour belt, and an armoured
barbette fore and aft, mounting a 9&frac12;-inch Hontoria gun.
They had a secondary armament of ten 6-inch quick-firers,
besides a number of lighter guns for defence against
torpedo craft, and had maxims mounted in their fighting
tops. The "Cristobal Colon," originally built for the
Italian Navy as the "Giuseppe Garibaldi," and purchased
by Spain and renamed, had only the quick-firers, and had
no guns in her barbettes. These had originally been armed
with Armstrong guns. The heavy Armstrongs were taken
out of her at Cadiz to be replaced by Hontorias, but these
were not ready when the war came, and the "Cristobal
Colon" sailed for St. Vincent without them. The torpedo-boat
destroyers were of the best and latest type of their
class, and recently built on the Clyde.</p>

<p>The war in the Atlantic began by Sampson's squadron
leaving Key West, establishing the blockade of Western
Cuba, reconnoitring the sea defences of Havana, and
exchanging some shells with them at long range. Then,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
in order to satisfy popular feeling in America, Sampson
bombarded the batteries of San Juan, in Puerto Rico, an
operation that had no real effect on the fortunes of the
war, and inflicted only trifling local loss on the Spaniards.</p>

<p>An army had been assembled at Tampa, in Florida, and
a huge fleet of transports was collected to ferry it over to
Cuba. Its destination was supposed to be the western end
of the island, where, in co-operation with the insurgents
by land and the fleet by sea, it would besiege and capture
Havana. But again and again the sailing of the fleet was
delayed, and there was alarm in the cities of the Atlantic
states, because the newspapers published wild reports of
phantom armadas hovering off the coast. When news
came that Cervera had sailed from St. Vincent, and for
many days there was no trace of his movements, there was
a quite unnecessary alarm as to what the Spanish squadron
might do. A wise Press censorship would have been very
useful to the United States, but there was little or no
attempt to control the wild rumours published by the
newspapers.</p>

<p>For some days after the declaration of war (23 April)
Cervera's squadron lay at St. Vincent. All the ships were
repainted a dead black, some coal was taken on board, and
quantities of ammunition transferred from the holds of the
"Ciudad de Cadiz" to the magazines of the cruisers. At
last, on 29 April, Cervera sailed, leaving the torpedo-boats
and the armed liner in port, and taking with him only his
high-speed ships, the four armoured cruisers, and the three
destroyers.</p>

<p>His course was westward, and it was conjectured that
San Juan de Puerto Rico was his destination. The distance
is about 2400 miles, and supposing that he would proceed
at a cruising speed of ten knots, in order to economize his
coal, it was calculated that he would be across the Atlantic
in ten days, reaching the West Indies about 9 May. Two
swift armed liners that had been attached to Schley's
squadron were sent out to sweep the Western Atlantic,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and it was expected that by the end of the first week in
May they would bring back news of the enemy, but 7 May
came and brought no news. Ships arriving in ports on
both sides of the ocean told of having seen the smoke of
a squadron on the horizon in so many places that it seemed
as if the Atlantic must be full of fleets. Look-out stations
as far north as the New England States told of glimpses of
warships seen far off in the morning twilight, or vaguely
distinguished through mist and rain. But definite news
of Cervera there was none. It seemed as if his squadron
had vanished into space.</p>

<p>Then there were theories started to account for his disappearance.
It was suggested that he had altered his
course and gone to the coast of South America, to intercept
the battleship "Oregon," which had come round from the
Pacific to reinforce Sampson's fleet; or perhaps he was
making for the Cape or the Horn, bound on a long voyage
for Manila, to destroy Dewey's unarmoured cruisers and
restore Spanish supremacy in the Philippines; or he was
ranging the oceans to prey upon American commerce.</p>

<p>Then came a strange report, worth remembering as a
caution against too easily accepting the rumours of wartime.
From Cadiz came American Press dispatches, duly
passed by the Spanish censor, stating that Cervera's
squadron had steamed back into that port. The start
westward from St. Vincent was said to be a mere feint.
The Spaniards had hoped to draw some of the swifter
American ships out into the Atlantic, and score a victory
by fighting them in European waters. Naval experts
gravely discussed Cervera's tactics. Correspondents described
the position of his fleet in Cadiz harbour. Perhaps
the Spanish censor helped the misleading rumours into
circulation by letting Americans at Cadiz imagine that
ships fitting out in the harbour were the missing fleet.</p>

<p>At last, on 12 May, came definite news of one unit of the
squadron. The night before the destroyer "Furor" had
paid a flying visit in the dark to the French port of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Pierre, in Martinique, probably calling for cabled information
and orders. On the 12th the "Terror" visited the
same port in broad daylight. That evening, from the hills
of Martinique, four large cruisers were seen far out at sea,
steering northwards, under easy steam. The cable from
Martinique by St. Lucia to the States was out of order, and
it was not till the 15th that Admiral Sampson received the
news. Several of his heavy ships were coaling at Key West.
He hurried on the work, and sent his lighter ships to watch
the Windward and Mona Passages. He sent off Schley with
the Flying Squadron to the south of Cuba, with orders to
sweep the island-fringed Caribbean sea and watch the
Yucatan Channel with his cruisers. As soon as he had
completed coaling he himself sailed for the waters north of
Cuba.</p>

<p>Once more there was for a while no news of Cervera.
After dark on 12 May he had altered his northern course
and steered a little south of west, making for the Dutch
island of Cura&ccedil;ao, where he expected to find some tramp
steamers laden with coal and other supplies awaiting him.
On Saturday, 14 May, the "Maria Teresa" and the
"Vizcaya" entered the port, the two other cruisers,
accompanied by two destroyers, remaining outside. The
expected colliers had not arrived; the Dutch authorities
insisted on Cervera leaving Cura&ccedil;ao within twenty-four
hours, and he sailed on the Sunday without being able to
fill up his bunkers. Once more the United States cruisers
failed to sight him, as he steamed slowly across the Caribbean
Sea, husbanding his coal and steering for Cuba.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 18 May, three American warships were
off Santiago de Cuba. They came so close in that the
Morro battery at the entrance fired upon them. Before
sundown they steamed away. They had missed Cervera
by a few hours, for at sunrise next morning he brought his
four cruisers and two destroyers into Santiago harbour.</p>

<p>Santiago is the oldest Spanish city in Cuba, and was its
capital in the early days before Havana was founded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p>The old city stands at the head of a landlocked arm of
the sea, surrounded by forest-clad hills, and approached
through narrow ravine-like straits. Cervera had come
there to obtain coal and supplies. If he had made it only
a temporary base, and had been able to coal immediately,
and put to sea to attack the American cruisers scattered
over the Caribbean waters, he might have scored successes
for a while. But he waited at Santiago till he was hopelessly
blockaded.</p>

<p>For some days the Washington Government, mindful of
the Cadiz hoax, refused to believe reports that the Spanish
fleet was hidden behind the headlands of Santiago harbour.
It was not till 27 May that Admiral Schley obtained definite
proof of the fact, and formed the blockade of Santiago with
his squadron. Admiral Sampson then brought his fleet
round, and took over the command.</p>

<p>Until he reached Santiago Cervera had shown no lack of
energy, but now he was strangely devoid of enterprise. He
allowed an American armed liner to capture, off the port, a
steamer that was bringing him 3000 tons of much-needed
coal, though he might have saved her by sending one of his
cruisers outside the headlands. He allowed an inferior
force to blockade the entrance for some days, without
bringing out his cruisers by day to engage them, or sending
out his destroyers by night to torpedo them. He waited
until there was an overwhelming force assembled off the
harbour.</p>

<p>Then came a month of deadlock. He was blockaded by a
vastly superior force that watched the narrow pass through
which, if he left the harbour, his fleet must come out one
by one. But so long as he was within the headlands he was
unassailable.</p>

<p>Admiral Sampson declined to risk his ships in an attempt
to force the narrow entrance and destroy the Spanish
squadron inside. An attempt to "bottle up" Cervera, by
sinking a tramp steamer, the "Merrimac," in the entrance,
proved a failure. Long-ranging bombardments produced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
no effect on the Spaniards. All the plans formed at Washington
for the Cuban campaign were disorganized. The
blockade of the island had become the blockade of the one
port of Santiago. If the United States Government had
known how short of supplies were the city and garrison of
Santiago and Cervera's fleet, it might have trusted to the
blockade by sea and the operations of the insurgents by
land, with the help of a few regulars, to force the Spanish
admiral either to surrender or come out and fight. But it
was decided to abandon for the present the projected attack
on Havana, and send the army, collected for this purpose
at Tampa, to attack Santiago by land, and so deprive
Cervera of his refuge in the harbour.</p>

<p>Santiago was defended by lines of entrenchments with
some improvised outworks, and garrisoned by a division
under General Linares. The American transports from
Tampa began to arrive on 20 June, and the expeditionary
force, under General Shafter, was disembarked during the
following days some miles east of the city. There was then
an advance over mere forest tracks through hilly country
covered with dense bush. Cervera landed seamen gunners
with machine-guns and light quick-firers to strengthen the
defence, and anchored one of his cruisers so that her heavy
artillery could enfilade an attack on the entrenchments
nearest the harbour.</p>

<p>On 1 July Shafter made his attack. The Spaniards defended
themselves with such obstinate energy that after
fighting through a long summer day only two outposts
had been taken by the Americans, and at the cost of heavy
loss. Next day there was desultory fighting along the
front, but no progress. It was difficult to bring up supplies
along the forest tracks, now sodden with tropical rains.
Sickness had broken out in the American lines. The
resistance of the Spaniards showed a dogged determination
that was a surprise to the invaders.</p>

<p>Shafter himself was ill. Late on Saturday, 2 July, he
appealed to Admiral Sampson to help him by forcing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
narrows at all costs, and in the early hours of Sunday, the
3rd, he sent off to his Government a dispatch which was a
confession of failure.</p>

<p>This discouraging report was cabled to Washington early
on the Sunday morning, and caused deep dismay at the
White House, but before evening news arrived of events
that had changed the whole situation.</p>

<p>The evening before (2 July) Mr. Ramsden, the British
Consul at Santiago, had written in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It seems incredible that the Americans with their
large force have not yet taken the place. The defence
of the Spaniards has been really heroic, the more so when
you consider that they are half-starved and sick. It
was affirmed to-day that the squadron would leave this
evening, but they have not done so, though the pilots
are on board. I will believe it when I see them get out,
and I wish they would. If they do, they will fare badly
outside."</p></div>

<p>During the Saturday Cervera had re-embarked the seamen
landed for the defence of the city, and had got up
steam. He was going out because the presence of his
crews now only added to the difficulty of feeding the half-starved
garrison and population of the place. He had a
short supply of inferior coal, and the most he hoped for
was that some of his ships would elude, or fight their way
past, the blockading squadron, and reach Havana. It is
impossible to understand why, having decided to go out,
he did not make the attempt in the darkness of Saturday
night, instead of waiting for broad daylight next
day.</p>

<p>In one respect he was fortunate. His coming out was a
complete surprise for the Americans, and found them quite
unprepared, with some of their best ships far from the
scene of action. Admiral Sampson had steamed off to the
eastward in his flagship, the "New York," intending to
land at Siboney for his interview with General Shafter.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
The battleship "Massachusetts" had gone with two of
the lighter cruisers to coal at Guantanamo. But there were
quite enough ships left off the seaward opening of the
narrows, where four battleships, an armoured cruiser, and
two light craft were keeping up the blockade.</p>

<p>It was a bright summer day, with a light wind and a
smooth sea. Due south of the harbour entrance, and about
5&frac12; miles from it, lay the battleship "Iowa." To the east
of her lay the "Oregon," with the "Indiana" between
her and the land, and about two miles nearer in, west of
the "Iowa," was the battleship "Texas," with the armoured
cruiser "Brooklyn," Commodore Schley's flagship,
lying between her and the land, and still nearer in
the small armed revenue cruiser "Vixen," lying about
three miles south-west of Morro Castle. On the other side
of the entrance, close in to the land, was a small armed
steamer, the "Gloucester." She had been purchased by
the Navy Department on the outbreak of the war from
Mr. Pierpont Morgan, the banker, and renamed. Before
this she had been known as the steam yacht "Gloucester."
She was commanded by one of the best officers of the
United States Navy, Captain Wainwright, who had been
second in command of the "Maine" when she was blown
up in Havana harbour. Wainwright was to show this day
that even an armed steam yacht may do good service in a
modern naval action. All the ships except the "Oregon"
and the little "Gloucester" had let their fires burn low,
and had hardly any steam pressure on their boilers. At
half-past nine the order was given for the crews to fall in
for general inspection. A few minutes later an apprentice
on board the "Iowa" called attention to a mass of black
smoke rising over the headlands of the harbour mouth.
And then between the cliffs of Morro and Socapa Points
appeared the bows of Cervera's flagship. An alarm gun
rang out from the "Iowa," the signal, "Enemy escaping&mdash;clear
for action," fluttered out from the halyards of the
"Brooklyn," and on every ship the bugles sounded, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
men rushed to their battle stations, and the stokers worked
madly to get steam on the boilers.</p>

<p>Admiral Cervera, guided by a local pilot, Miguel Lopez,
had led his fleet down the harbour, the "Maria Teresa"
being followed in succession by the cruisers "Vizcaya,"
"Cristobal Colon," and "Oquendo," and the destroyers
"Pluton" and "Furor." As the flagship entered the
ravine of the narrows Cervera signalled to his captains,
"I wish you a speedy victory!" Miguel Lopez, who was
with him in the conning-tower, remarked that the admiral
gave his orders very deliberately, and showed no sign of
anxiety or excitement. He had asked Lopez to tell him
how soon he could turn to the westward. On a sign from
the pilot, he gave the order, "Starboard!" to the helmsman,
put the engine-room indicator to "Full speed," and
told his captain to open fire. As the guns roared out
Cervera turned with a smile to Lopez and said, "You have
done your part well, pilot; I hope you will come out of this
safe and be well rewarded. You have deserved it."</p>

<p>The cruisers had run out with an interval of about 600
yards between the ships. There was a longer gap between
the last of them and the destroyers, but the "Furor" was
out within a quarter of an hour of the "Maria Teresa's"
appearance between the headlands. That quarter of an
hour had been a busy time for the Americans. The "Brooklyn"
and the four battleships had at once headed for the
opening of the harbour, the "Oregon" making the best
speed till the steam pressure rose on the boilers of her
consorts. They were no sooner moving than they opened
fire with their forward guns, the Spanish cruisers and the
batteries of Socapa and Morro replying with shots, every
one of which fell short.</p>

<p>As Cervera turned westward the American ships also
altered their course in the same direction. And now as
the huge ships of the blockading squadron, each wrapped
in a fog of smoke from her guns, converged upon the same
course, there was a momentary danger of disastrous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
collision between them, a danger accentuated by an unexpected
man&#0339;uvre of Commodore Schley's ship, the
"Brooklyn." The "Texas" and the "Iowa" just
cleared each other in the smoke-cloud. As they sheered off
from each other, the "Oregon," which had been following
the "Iowa," came rushing between the two ships, and the
"Brooklyn" circled past their bows, suddenly crossing
their course. Schley, in the first dash towards the Spaniards,
had brought his great cruiser within 3000 yards of the
"Maria Teresa," then seeing the Spanish flagship turning,
as if to ram, he swung round to starboard, bringing his
broadside to bear on the enemy, but at the same time
heading for his own battleships. He cleared them by completing
a circle, coming back thus to the westward course,
which had at the same time been resumed by the Spanish
flagship. As the "Brooklyn" turned the battleships swept up
between her and the enemy, masking her fire, the "Oregon"
leading, but the speed of Schley's ship soon enabled him
to secure a forward place in the chase near the "Oregon."</p>

<p>While the giants were thus man&#0339;uvring the little
"Gloucester" had come pluckily into action. Running in
close under the Morro batteries, Commander Wainwright
had fired some shots at the enemy's cruisers. Then
realizing that his light guns could do them no vital harm,
he almost stopped the way on his ship, and waited to
engage the destroyers. Out came the "Furor" and
"Pluton," turning eastward as they cleared the entrance,
and dashing for the "Gloucester" with a mass of foam
piling up over their bows. The "Indiana," the rearmost of
the battleships, fired some long-range shots at them, but
it was a stream of small shells from the "Gloucester's"
quick-firers that stopped their rush. The "Furor" was
soon drifting towards the cliffs, enveloped in clouds of
escaping steam. The "Gloucester's" fire had killed her
helmsman, wrecked her steering gear, and cut up several
of her steam-pipes, making her engine-room uninhabitable.
The "Pluton," not so badly crippled, but with her hull
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
penetrated in several places, was next turned back. The
"New York," hurrying up from the eastward at the sound
of the firing, escorted by the torpedo-boat "Ericsson,"
fired on her at long range. The "Pluton" kept her engines
going just long enough to drive her ashore under the Socapa
cliffs. The "Furor" sank before she could reach the land.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>There was now a running fight, the four Spanish cruisers
steaming westward close to the wooded shore, the American
ships following them up and pouring in a deadly fire from
every gun that could be brought to bear. It was soon
evident that the Spaniards could not get up anything like
their trial speed, and their gunnery was so defective that
there was small chance of their stopping any of their
pursuers by well-aimed fire, or even of inflicting any
appreciable loss or damage on them. The "Maria Teresa"
was the first to succumb. As she led the line out of the
harbour she had received the converging fire of the American
ships, but she had not suffered any serious injury.
Until the American ships got up full steam the Spaniards
had gained a little on them. An Englishman, Mr. Mason,
who watched the cruisers from a hill near Morro, till at ten
o'clock the curve of the coast westward hid them from
view, thought they were successfully escaping. So far as
he could see they had not been badly hit, and none of the
Americans were yet abreast of them. But soon after the
ships disappeared from the point of view near Morro, and
when the "Maria Teresa" was only some six miles from
the entrance, she suffered a series of injuries in rapid succession
that put her out of action.</p>

<p>It was the secondary armament of the American ships,
the guns of medium calibre, that proved most effective in
the running fight. It appears that the big 13 and 12-inch
barbette and turret guns only made two hits in the whole
day. Two 12-inch shells fired simultaneously from a pair
of guns struck the "Maria Teresa" just above the waterline
on the port side, aft and below her stern turret. They
burst in the torpedo-room, killing and wounding every one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
there, blowing a jagged hole in the starboard side, and
setting the ship on fire. An 8-inch shell came into the after
battery and exploded between decks, causing many
casualties. A 5-inch shell burst in the coal-bunkers amidships,
blew up the deck, and started a second fire. Another
destructive hit was made by an 8-inch shell a few feet
forward of the point where the pair of 12-inch shells had
come in. The official report thus describes its course:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An 8-inch shell struck the gun-deck just under the
after-barbette, passed through the side of the ship, and
exploded, ranging aft. The damage done by this shell was
very great. All the men in the locality must have been
killed or badly wounded. The beams were torn and ripped.
The fragments of the shell passed across the deck and cut
through the starboard side. This shell also cut the fire main."</p></div>

<p>Shells from the lighter artillery of the American ships
riddled the funnels, and cut up the deck-houses. One of
these shells, bursting near the forward bridge, wounded
Admiral Cervera slightly in the arm. He had come outside
the conning-tower the better to watch the progress of his
squadron. The armour belt had kept the water-line of the
ship intact, and her barbettes and heavy guns were also
protected efficiently by the local armour, but the enemy's
shell fire had told on the unarmoured structure, inflicted
heavy loss, and started two serious fires. All efforts to get
these under failed. The blazing tropic heat had scorched
the woodwork of the ship into tinder, the movement of the
vessel produced a draught that made the burning bunkers
and decks roaring masses of flame. The men were driven
by the heat from battery and engine-room. The "Maria
Teresa," with silent guns and masses of black smoke
ascending to the sky, was headed for the land. At a quarter-past
ten she drove ashore at Nimanima, 6&frac12; miles west
of Morro Castle. Some of the men swam ashore, others
were taken off by the boats of the "Gloucester," which
came up just in time to help in saving life. Commander
Wainwright had to land a party to drive off a mob of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Cuban guerillas, who came down to the shore, and were
murdering the hapless Spaniards as they swam to the
land. One of the "Gloucester's" boats took out of the
water Admiral Cervera and his son, Lieutenant Cervera.
They were brought on board the yacht, where Wainwright
chivalrously greeted the unfortunate admiral with the
words: "I congratulate you, sir, on having made as
gallant a fight as was ever witnessed on the sea."</p>

<p>At half-past ten another of the Spanish cruisers was a
helpless wreck only half a mile westward of the stranded
and burning flagship. This was the "Almirante Oquendo,"
whose station had been last in the line. This drew upon
her a converging fire from the guns of the pursuing battleships
and cruisers. The destruction was terrible. Two
guns of the secondary battery were disabled. A shell came
through the roof of the forward turret, killed and wounded
all the gun crew, and put the gun permanently out of
action. Ventilators and deck-fittings were swept away,
the funnels cut up, and the unarmoured part of the sides
repeatedly pierced by shells that started several fires amidships.
It was these that made further effort to keep up the
fight hopeless. After her captain, Juan Lazaga, had been
killed by a bursting shell, the "Oquendo," now on fire in a
dozen places, was driven ashore to save life. She blew up
on the beach, the explosion of her magazines nearly cutting
the wreck in two.</p>

<p>Of the Spanish squadron only the "Cristobal Colon"
and the "Vizcaya" still survived. The "Colon," best
and newest of the cruisers, was making good speed, and
was furthest ahead. The "Vizcaya" lagged behind her,
hard pressed by several American ships, led by the "Iowa."
The "Vizcaya" had suffered severely from the fire of the
pursuit. Her coal-bunkers were ablaze on one side, and
there was another fire making steady progress in the gun-deck.
Schley, in the "Brooklyn," urging his engines to
the utmost, rushed past the "Iowa," and attempted to
head off the "Vizcaya." Her gallant captain, Antonio
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Eulate, realized that the "Brooklyn" was the swiftest
ship in the pursuit, and that her destruction would materially
increase the chance of the "Colon" escaping. So he
made a last effort to ram or torpedo the "Brooklyn"
before his own ship succumbed. He headed for Schley
with a torpedo ready in his bow over-water tube. A shell
from the "Brooklyn's" battery struck it fair, exploded
the torpedo in the tube, and blew up and set fire to the forepart
of the "Vizcaya." Eulate then headed his ship for
the land, and she struck the shore under the cliffs at
Asseradores, fifteen miles west of Morro, at a quarter-past
eleven. The "Brooklyn," the "Iowa," and the "Oregon"
were pouring their fire into her as she ran aground. Another
explosion blew up part of her burning decks, and Eulate
hauled down his flag. The Americans cheered as they saw
the flag come down amid the clouds of smoke, but Captain
Robley Evans, of the "Iowa," called out from the bridge
to stop the cheers of his men. "Don't cheer, boys. Those
poor fellows are dying," he said. Evans, with the "Iowa,"
stood by the burning ship to rescue the survivors.</p>

<p>The "Colon" alone remained. She had a lead of a good
six miles, and many thought she would escape. The
"Brooklyn" led the pursuit, followed closely by the
battleships "Oregon" and "Texas," and the small
cruiser "Vixen," with Sampson's flagship, the "New
York," far astern, too far off to have any real share in
the action. On her trials the "Colon" had done 23 knots.
If she could have done anything like this in the rush out
of Santiago, she would have simply walked away from
the Americans, but she never did more than fourteen.
For some time, even at this reduced speed, she was so
far ahead that there was no firing. It was not until ten
minutes past one that the "Brooklyn" and "Oregon"
at last got within range and opened fire with their forward
heavy guns. The "Colon," with her empty barbettes,
had nothing with which to reply at the long range.
In the earlier stage of the fight she had been hit only by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
an 8-inch shell, which did no material damage. As the
pursuers gained on her she opened with her secondary
battery. Even now she received no serious injury, and
she was never set on fire. But her captain, Moreu, realized
that lack of speed had put him at the mercy of the enemy.
As they closed in upon him and opened fire with their
heaviest guns, he turned his ship into the creek surrounded
by towering heights amid which the little Tarquino River
runs into the sea, forty-eight miles west of Morro Castle. He
hauled down his flag as he entered the creek. Without his
orders the engineers opened the Kingston valves in the
engine-room, and when the Americans boarded the "Colon"
she was rapidly sinking. She went down by the stern
under the cliffs on the east side of the inlet, and lay with
her bow above water and her after decks awash. It was
twenty minutes past one when she surrendered.</p>

<p>The men of the "Iowa" and "Gloucester" had meanwhile
rescued many of the survivors of the "Vizcaya,"
not without serious risk to themselves, for there were
numerous explosions, and the decks were red-hot in places.
Some of the Spaniards swam ashore, made their way
through the bush to Santiago, and joined the garrison.
Captain Eulate was brought on board the "Iowa," and
received by a guard of marines, who presented arms as
he stepped from the gangway. He offered his sword to
Robley Evans, but the American captain refused to take it.
"You have surrendered," he said, "to four ships, each
heavier than your own. You did not surrender to the
'Iowa' only, so her captain cannot take your sword."</p>

<p>Never in any naval action was there such complete
destruction of a fleet. Of the six ships that steamed out of
Santiago that summer morning, the "Furor" was sunk in
deep water off the entrance; the "Pluton" was ashore
under the Socapa cliff. At various points along the coast
columns of black smoke rising a thousand feet into the sunlit
sky showed where the burning wrecks of the "Maria
Teresa," the "Oquendo," and the "Vizcaya" lay, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
nearly fifty miles away the "Colon" was sunk at the mouth
of the Tarquino River.</p>

<p>And never was success obtained with such a trifling loss
to the victors. The Spanish gunnery had been wretchedly
bad. The only ships hit were the "Brooklyn" and the
"Iowa," and neither received any serious damage. The
only losses by the enemy's fire were on board the "Brooklyn,"
where a signalman was killed and two seamen
wounded. Nine men were more or less seriously injured by
the concussion of their own guns.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the gunnery of the Americans
was not of a high order. Some 6500 shells were expended
during the action. The Spanish wrecks were carefully
examined, and all hits counted. Fires and explosions
perhaps obliterated the traces of some of them, but so far
as could be ascertained, the hits on the hulls and the upper
works were comparatively few. And of hits by the heavy 13-inch
and 12-inch guns, only two could be traced anywhere.</p>

<p>The Spanish squadron had 2300 officers and men on
board when it left Santiago. Of these 1600 were prisoners
after the action. It was estimated that in the fight 350
were killed and 150 wounded. This leaves some 200 to be
accounted for. Nearly 150 rejoined the garrison of Santiago
after swimming ashore. This leaves only fifty missing.
They were probably drowned or killed by the Cuban
guerillas. The fact that three of the Spanish cruisers had
been rendered helpless by fires lighted on board by the
enemy's shells accentuated the lesson already learned from
the battle of the Yalu as to the necessity of eliminating
inflammable material in the construction and fittings of
warships. The damage done to the "Vizcaya" by the explosion
of one of her own torpedoes in her bow-tube proved
the reality of a danger to which naval critics had already
called attention. Henceforth the torpedo tubes of cruisers
and battleships were all made to open below the water-line.</p>

<p>The result of the victory was a complete change in the
situation at Santiago. The destruction of Cervera's fleet was
the "beginning of the end" for the Spanish power in Cuba.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="title">
TSU-SHIMA<br />
1905</p>


<p>When the war of 1894&ndash;5 between China and Japan
was brought to a close by the Treaty of Shimonoseki
(17 April, 1895), the Japanese were in possession of
Korea and Southern Manchuria, Port Arthur and the Liao-tung
Peninsula, Wei-hai-wei and the Pescadores Islands,
and a joint naval and military expedition was ready to
seize Formosa.</p>

<p>By the second article China ceded to Japan the fortress
and dockyard of Port Arthur and the Liao-tung Peninsula.
As soon as the terms of the treaty were published, Russia,
which was the northern neighbour of China along the
borders of Manchuria and Mongolia, and the neighbour of
Japan by the possession of Vladivostock and Saghalien,
protested against the cession of Port Arthur and its territory
to the victors, arguing that the permanent occupation
of Port Arthur by a foreign Power would be a standing
menace to the Government at Pekin, and would put an
end to the independence of China. Germany and France
joined in the Russian protest, and the three Powers began
to move their ships eastward. Their combined squadrons
would have been more than a match for Admiral Ito's
cruisers. England had a powerful squadron in the Eastern
seas, but observed a strict neutrality in the diplomatic strife.</p>

<p>If England had joined her, Japan would undoubtedly
have fought rather than yield up the fruit of her hard-won
victories. But the Mikado's Ministers realized that single-handed
they could not face a Triple Alliance of aggressive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
European Powers. The treaty was revised, the cession of
Port Arthur and its territory being struck out of it. They
were to be restored to China.</p>

<p>But the statesmen of Japan, while they yielded the
point, recognized in Russia their future rival for the empire
of the East, and resolved to begin at once preparing for a
struggle in years to come which would give them back
more than they were now forced to abandon. They set to
work to create a powerful navy, and at the same time added
steadily to the fighting strength of their army, which for a
while found useful war training in the subjugation of the
hill tribes of Formosa. The millions of the war indemnity
and loans negotiated abroad were expended on a great
scheme of armaments. A fleet of battleships, cruisers, and
torpedo craft was built in foreign shipyards, and the
personnel of the navy was increased to provide officers and
crews. The Japanese Government went on for years
patiently preparing, regardless of conduct on the part of
Russia that might have tempted a less self-possessed Power
to premature action.</p>

<p>The Russian Government had hardly forced Japan to
abandon so large a part of her conquests when it took
advantage of the weakness of China to obtain from the
Pekin Government the right to make a railway through
Manchuria to the treaty port of Niu-chwang, and to place
garrisons along the new line for its protection, and further
the right to garrison Port Arthur, use it as a naval station,
and occupy the adjacent territory. When the first rumours
of the Russo-Chinese Treaty reached Europe they were
treated with incredulity. It was said that it was impossible
that Russia could cynically claim a position which she had
just declared was incompatible with the independence of
China, and which she had argued the nations of Europe
could not permit to Japan or any other Power. But presently
the treaty was published, and acted upon, Russia
making Port Arthur her chief naval station in the East,
announcing a project for a great commercial port at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Talienwan Bay, and, further, occupying the treaty port of
Niu-chwang. There was a brief period of tension, during
which there was a talk of various Powers resisting this
barefaced aggression, but European statesmen thought
that an easier course was open to them. Instead of resisting
the aggressor, they embarked in a policy of aggression
themselves, on the plea of securing compensations and
guarantees. The weakness of China made her the ready
victim of this policy.</p>

<p>Foreign aggression from so many quarters called forth a
patriotic movement in China, which in 1900 culminated in
the "Boxer" revolt. For a while Japan and the European
Powers, including Russia, became allies, to save their
embassies and repress the rising about Pekin. In the
campaign the Japanese forces proved themselves the most
efficient of all, and their chiefs returned home with an
absolute confidence that they could successfully meet
European soldiers in the field.</p>

<p>Japan had made the most unsparing use of its rights
in Korea, acquired by the Treaty of Shimonoseki, all but
absolutely annexing the country. After the Boxer revolt
Admiral Alexieff, who was governor of the Russian possessions
in the Far East, embarked on a dangerous policy of
provocation towards Japan. He had an ill-informed contempt
for the hardy islanders. He underrated their power
of resistance, and felt sure that the mere fact that the
Russian fleet outnumbered theirs would secure the command
of the sea for Russia, and have a decisive effect in
the event of a conflict. He believed that the sooner it
came the better.</p>

<p>The Russian fleet in the East was steadily reinforced,
unit by unit. The Japanese people began to see in these
proceedings, and in the work done at Port Arthur, a threat
of early hostilities, and there was a general call on the
Government to anticipate the blow, when relations became
strained between the two countries in 1903. The Tokio
Government was anxious not to precipitate the war, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
organization of the army required some months for completion,
but the feeling in the navy, army, and civil population
forced its hand. After a brief delay of negotiations,
during which both parties worked with feverish energy to
secure additional armaments, diplomatic relations were
broken off at the beginning of February, 1904, and then,
without waiting for any formal declaration of war, the
Japanese torpedo flotilla swooped down on the Russian
fleet lying in the roads outside the narrow entrance of Port
Arthur, found them utterly unprepared to meet this sudden
attack, and crippled several of the ships. A second blow
was the destruction of the first-class armoured cruiser
"Variag," the Russian guardship at Chemulpo, by a
Japanese squadron.</p>

<p>Most of the best ships in the Russian navy were in the
East at the outbreak of the war. Alexieff had, however,
made the initial mistake of dividing the force at his disposal.
Away north at Vladivostock was a squadron of
three large armoured cruisers, the "Gromoboi," "Rossia,"
and "Rurik," and the protected cruiser "Bogatyr." The
"Variag" was isolated at Chemulpo, the port of Seoul,
doing duty that might have been left to a gunboat. At Port
Arthur, under Admiral Stark, there was a strong fleet, including
seven battleships, the "Petropavlosk," "Poltava,"
"Peresviet," "Pobieda," "Retsivan," "<span class="ins" title="Sevastopol">Sebastopol</span>," and
"Tsarevitch," the cruisers "Askold," "Boyarin,"
"Bayan," "Pallada," "Diana," and "Novik," and a
flotilla of torpedo craft and the mine-laying steamer
"Yenessei." In the torpedo attack on the evening of
8 February the "Retsivan," "Tsarevitch," and "Pallada"
were badly damaged. The "Variag" was destroyed next
day, and a few days later the "Yenessei" accidentally blew
herself up while laying mines. This series of disasters
seemed for a while to have almost destroyed the <i>morale</i> of
the fleet. Stark set to work to repair his damaged ships,
made no attempt to meet the Japanese at sea, or interfere
with the transport of their armies to the mainland of Asia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and, subordinating his fleet to the defence of Port Arthur,
even landed guns and men to strengthen the landward
works. The Japanese blockaded the port, insulted it with
long-range bombardments, and tried to block the narrow
entrance by sinking old steamers across it.</p>

<p>In March the arrival of the best officer in the Russian
Navy, Admiral Makharoff, for a while inspired new energy
into the Port Arthur fleet. The repairs of the injured ships
were completed, and on 13 April the admiral steamed out to
challenge Togo and the main Japanese fleet to battle. Notwithstanding
precautions taken against the known danger
of floating mines, the fleet entered a tract of water where
several were afloat, and the flagship "Petropavlosk" was
destroyed with fearful suddenness by the explosion of one
of them. There was great loss of life, but the most serious
blow to Russia was the death of the admiral.</p>

<p>After the fleet returned to the harbour there came another
period of irresolute inactivity. It was not till August, when
several ships had been injured at their anchors by the
bombardment from the land batteries of the Japanese
attack, and it was evident that the port would soon be a
dangerous place for the ships, that Admiral Witjeft proceeded
to sea, announcing that he was going to Vladivostock,
the cruiser squadron from that port having been
warned to come out and reinforce him on his way.</p>

<p>The sea-fight, known as the battle of the Tenth of
August, took place a few miles to seaward of the port.
Witjeft led the fleet in his flagship the "Tsarevitch,"
followed by the battleships "Retsivan," "<span class="ins" title="Sevastopol">Sebastopol</span>,"
"Pobieda," "Poltava," and "Peresviet" (carrying the
flag of the second in command, Rear-Admiral Prince
Ukhtomsky), and the cruiser division made up of the
"Askold" (carrying the flag of Rear-Admiral Reitzenstein),
"Pallada," "Diana," and "Novik," besides eight
destroyers. The cruiser "Bayan" had been so damaged
that she was left in port. Witjeft had a marked superiority
in battleships. Togo had had six new first-rate ships of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the class under his command at the outset of the war, but
on 15 May he had lost two of them, one-third of his battleship
fleet, by a disaster like that of the "Petropavlosk."
On that May morning, while cruising off Port Arthur, he
ran into a field of drift mines, and in a few minutes the
battleships "Hatsuse" and "Yashima," and the cruiser
"Yoshino," were destroyed. The Japanese managed till
the end of the war to conceal the fact that the "Yashima"
had been lost, and the Russians up to the battle of Tsu-shima
believed Togo had five of his big battleships intact.
In the battle of 10 August he put in his main fighting-line
the two powerful armoured cruisers "Nisshin" and
"Kasuga," purchased from the Argentine Government on
the eve of the war.</p>

<p>The battle began with long-range firing at 1 p.m.,
and continued till after seven in the evening. It was decided
by the superior gunnery of the Japanese, and the
damage done by their high explosive shells. The "Tsarevitch,"
badly cut up and set on fire, was driven out of the
line. Witjeft was killed by a shell. His last word was to
reiterate his order to push for Vladivostock. As darkness
came on Ukhtomsky lost heart, and led the fleet back to
Port Arthur. If he had held on he might have got through
the Japanese fleet, for their ammunition was almost exhausted
when the firing ceased. Reitzenstein, with the
cruisers, tried to execute Witjeft's last order. The "Pallada,"
however, left him and followed the battleships. The
rest of the cruiser squadron and the destroyers that accompanied
it were forced to part company, and only the
"Novik" got through to the northwards. The "Diana"
fled southwards to the French port of Saigon; the "Askold,"
with a destroyer, reached Shanghai. The battered
"Tsarevitch," with three destroyers, took refuge at Kiao-chau.
All these ships were disarmed by the French, German,
and Chinese authorities, and detained till the end of
the war, when they were restored to the Russian Government.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<p>The "Novik" failed to get into Vladivostock, but
reached a Russian port in Saghalien, where a few days later
she was tracked down and destroyed by Japanese cruisers.
The Vladivostock squadron had come out to meet the
unfortunate Witjeft. The "Boyarin" was left behind,
damaged by accidentally grounding, so the squadron was
made up of the three big armoured cruisers "Gromoboi,"
"Rossia," and "Rurik." They were approaching the
straits of Tsu-shima, and were as far south as Fusan,
when they were discovered and attacked by Admiral
Kamimura's cruiser squadron, on 14 August. Once more
good gunnery against poor shooting decided the fight. The
"Rurik" was sunk, and the "Gromoboi" and "Rossia"
returned to Vladivostock, bearing marks of very hard
hitting&mdash;riddled funnels, and sides hastily patched with
plates of iron, told of the straight shooting of the Japanese
cruisers. In both the action with the Port Arthur battleship
fleet and the Vladivostock cruiser squadron the losses
of the Japanese had been very slight.</p>

<p>On paper the Russians had had a distinct superiority
over the Japanese in sea-power at the outset, so far as it
can be measured by balancing off battleships, cruisers, and
minor craft in parallel columns. In the months before the
war there was ample material for the enterprising journalist
to work up a navy scare at Tokio. But once more it was
shown that not the number of ships but the temper and
training of the men are the true measure of power on the
sea. From the first Togo had asserted his superiority, and
by asserting secured it. After the naval engagements of
10 and 14 August the Russian Navy in the Far East accepted
a position of helpless inaction. Ukhtomsky kept
what was left of the fine fleet, that had been originally
assembled at Port Arthur, anchored in the land-locked
harbour till the ships were sunk by fire of the besieging
batteries.</p>

<p>While the Far Eastern fleet was still in being, and Port
Arthur was holding out, the Russian Government had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
announced its intention of sending a second fleet from
Europe to the seat of war. It had two fleets in European
waters, those of the Black Sea and the Baltic. The Black
Sea fleet was not available. International treaties barred
its exit from the Dardanelles. Only the Baltic dockyards
could supply the new armada.</p>

<p>As soon as the news of the first torpedo attack on Port
Arthur arrived, in February, 1904, there was talk of the
new fleet for the East, and unofficially the end of June was
spoken of as the time when it would be ready to sail. From
the first it was obvious that this was an over-sanguine
estimate, unless the fleet was to be made up entirely of old
and weak ships. The best units that could be made available,
and without some at least of which the fleet could
hardly be sent out, were five powerful battleships that were
being completed in the Neva yards and at Cronstadt. Two
had been launched in 1901, two in 1902, and the fifth in
1903, but even on the 1901 ships there was a large amount
of work to be done. Naval experts declared that the fleet
would not be ready for a year, and that even then the
difficulty of coaling would make its voyage to the other
side of the world in war time a hopeless task for the admiral
in command.</p>

<p>By hard work the fleet was made ready for sea by the
middle of September. The coaling difficulty was overcome
by taking colliers with the fleet, contracting with a German
firm to send large coal-laden steamers to various points on
the route selected, and straining to the utmost the benevolent
neutrality of France, and using her colonial ports as
halting places on the way. There was some difficulty in
recruiting a sufficient number of engineer officers, and of
stokers who could manage the novel tubular boilers of the
new battleships, and the fleet was undoubtedly handicapped
by the inexperience of its engine-room and stokehold
staff.</p>

<p>Admiral Rojdestvensky, the officer chosen for the
supreme command, had an excellent record. He was fifty-six
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
years of age, and had served in the navy since 1865. In
the Russo-Turkish War he had distinguished himself by
brilliant attacks on Turkish ships of war with a small
torpedo gunboat, the "Vesta." He had been naval
attach&eacute; in London, and had filled important technical and
official positions at St. Petersburg, being for a while
chief of the general Naval Staff. Finally he had personal
knowledge of the Eastern seas and of the Japanese navy,
for he had commanded the Russian squadron in the Far
East during the war between China and Japan.</p>

<p>On 14 August&mdash;just after the news of the disastrous sortie
of the Port Arthur fleet had reached Europe, and on the
very day that Kamimura defeated the Vladivostock
squadron and sank the "Rurik"&mdash;Admiral Rojdestvensky
hoisted his flag on board his flagship, the "Knias Suvaroff,"
at Cronstadt. But there was still much work to be done,
and recent mishaps to some of the ships' machinery to be
made good, so the fleet did not sail till 25 August. Even
then it was only for a few days' training cruise in the Baltic.</p>

<p>On the 30th the fleet was back again at Cronstadt.
Engineers and mechanics worked night and day, setting
right defects in the ships, and on 11 September there was
another start, this time for the port of Libau.</p>

<p>The fleet consisted of seven battleships, two armoured
cruisers, and some protected cruisers and torpedo-boat
destroyers. It was to be joined at Libau by a miscellaneous
collection of craft&mdash;some small cruisers and a number of
merchantmen to be used as auxiliary cruisers, store, hospital,
and repair ships.</p>

<p>Of the five new battleships in the Neva yards four had
been got ready for sea. These were the "Borodino,"
"Orel," "Imperator Alexander&nbsp;III," and "Knias Suvaroff."
They were powerful ships of 13,000 to 13,500 tons
displacement, with engines of nominal 16,000 horse-power,
and their official speed, which they never realized, was
eighteen knots. Their heaviest armour was nine inches,
and they carried two pair of 12-inch guns fore and aft in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
armoured turrets, with an auxiliary armament of twelve
6-inch quick-firers besides lighter guns. The three other
battleships, the "Ossliabya," "Navarin," and "Sissoi
Veliki" were older ships. The newest of them, the
"Ossliabya," launched in 1898, was on her way to the East
when the war broke out, and had turned back. She was
of 12,600 tons displacement, and claimed a speed of eighteen
knots. She carried four 10-inch and eleven 6-inch guns.
The other two ships were rated as having sixteen knots
speed, but probably could not much exceed twelve. Their
displacement and principal armament were:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li><i>Navarin</i>, 10,000 tons, four 12-inch guns, eight 6-inch Q.F.</li>
<li><i>Sissoi Veliki</i>, 8880 tons, four 12-inch guns, six 6-inch Q.F.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two armoured cruisers were old ships:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li><i>Admiral Nakhimoff</i>, 8500 tons, eight 8-inch, ten 6-inch guns.</li>
<li><i>Dimitri Donskoi</i>, 7796 tons, six 6-inch, ten 4.7 inch guns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two of the protected cruisers, the "Aurora" and
"Oleg," were ships of about 7000 tons, carrying for their
main armament the former eight and the latter twelve
6-inch guns. The other cruisers were four smaller ships,
but some of them were comparatively new vessels with
good speed&mdash;useful as scouts.</p>

<p>Well manned with competent engineers and trained
gunners the fleet would have been formidable enough,
notwithstanding its weaker units. But here again it was
the men that counted.</p>

<p>In the first week of October the fleet was taken to Revel.
The Tsar arrived there on the 9th and inspected it next
day. On the 11th it sailed. But it stopped again at Libau,
until October 15, when at last it started for the East.</p>

<p>There had been wild rumours that the Japanese had sent
emissaries to Europe, obtained some light craft, and fitted
them as improvised torpedo-boats for the purpose of
attacking the fleet on its voyage through the narrow
waters that form the exit from the Baltic or during the
crossing of the North Sea. The Russian police attached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
such importance to these canards that Rojdestvensky was
warned to take precaution against attack until he was out
on the open ocean. He passed the Danish straits with his
ships partly cleared for action, fired on a Swedish merchantman
and a German fishing-boat, and, avoiding the
usual course from the Skaw to the Channel, ran by the
Dogger Bank, and in a panic of false alarm opened fire on
the steam trawling fleet, sinking a boat and killing and
wounding several men. The result was an outburst of
indignation in England, a partial mobilization of the
British fleet, and some days of extreme tension, when it
seemed likely that England would be drawn into the war,
with the probability that France would then, under the
terms of her alliance with Russia, have also to enter into
the conflict. An agreement was arranged under which
there was to be an international inquiry into the Dogger
Bank incident, and Russia promised to make full reparation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Baltic fleet had run down Channel and
across the Bay of Biscay, and southwards to Tangier,
where it was concentrated on 3 November, watched by
Lord Charles Beresford and the Channel Fleet, for the
period of sharp tension was not over. At Tangier Rojdestvensky
divided his force. He went southward along the
African coast with the first division, and sent the second
division under Admiral F&ouml;lkersham into the Mediterranean
to go eastwards by the Suez Canal route. A third division
had been formed at Libau to reinforce the fleet. It was
composed of the armoured cruisers "Izumrud" and
"Oleg," three auxiliary cruisers (armed liners of the
volunteer fleet), the "Terek," "Rion," and "Dnieper,"
a flotilla of destroyers, and a number of storeships. It
sailed from Libau on 7 November.</p>

<p>Rojdestvensky put into various African ports, mostly in
the French colonies, and coaled his ships from his colliers.
He was at Dakar, in West Africa, on 13 November; at
Gaboon on the 26th; in Great Fish Bay on 6 December;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and at Angra Peque&ntilde;a on the 11th. He passed Cape Town
on 19 December. Rounding the Cape, he steered for
Madagascar, and on 1 January, 1905, he anchored in the
Bay of Ste. Marie, near Tamatave.</p>

<p>On that same New Year's Day General Stoessel sent a flag
of truce out to General Nogi, to inform him that he was
anxious to arrange the immediate surrender of Port Arthur.
The capitulation was signed next day. Thus at the very
moment that Rojdestvensky and the main fighting force
of the Baltic fleet established itself in the Indian Ocean,
its nearest possible base in the Eastern seas passed into
Japanese hands, and the problem the Russian admiral
had to solve became more difficult.</p>

<p>F&ouml;lkersham, with the second division, rejoined Rojdestvensky's
division in the waters of Madagascar.</p>

<p>From Ste. Marie the fleet moved to the roadstead of
Nossi-B&eacute;, at the north end of Madagascar, where it was
joined in February by the reinforcements for Libau.
Rojdestvensky had now under his command an armada of
some forty ships of all kinds, including storeships and
colliers. Now that Port Arthur had fallen he seemed in no
hurry to proceed eastwards.</p>

<p>There had been an agitation in Russia for a further reinforcement
of the fleet, and though the addition of a few
more old and weak ships could add no real strength to
Rojdestvensky's armada, the Government yielded to the
clamour, and on February 15 dispatched from Libau a
fourth division, under the command of Admiral Nebogatoff.
The flagship was an armoured turret-ship, the
"Imperator Nikolai&nbsp;I," of 9700 tons, dating from 1889,
and classed in the Navy List as a battleship; with her
went three small armoured "coast-defence battleships,"
the "General Admiral Apraxin," the "Admiral Ushakoff,"
and the "Admiral <span class="ins" title="Seniavine">Senyavin</span>," all of about 4000 tons, and
the cruiser "Vladimir Monomach," of a little over 5500
tons. Rojdestvensky seemed inclined to wait at Nossi-B&eacute;
for Nebogatoff's arrival, but the Japanese addressed strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
protests to Paris against Madagascar being made a base
of operations for a huge expedition against them; the
French Government sent pressing remonstrances to their
friends at St. Petersburg, and the admiral was ordered by
cable to move on.</p>

<p>Sailing from Nossi-B&eacute; on 25 March, Rojdestvensky
steered first for the Chagos Archipelago, and then for the
Straits of Malacca. In the afternoon of 8 April the fleet
passed Singapore, keeping well out to sea. The ships were
burning soft coal, and an enormous cloud of black smoke
trailed from the forest of funnels. Steamers ran out from
the port to see the splendid sight of the great crowd of
ships moving four abreast into the China Sea. Before the
fleet sailed many critics of naval matters had prophesied
that as Russia had no coaling stations the coaling difficulty
would make it impossible for Rojdestvensky ever to carry
his fleet so far. The successful entry into the Eastern seas
was therefore regarded as something of an exploit. It was
a revelation of the far-reaching power that would belong
to better-equipped fleets in future wars.</p>

<p>While the Baltic fleet was on its way the Japanese
Government, patriotically supported by the Press and the
people, kept a strict silence on all naval matters. There
were wild conjectures that under this veil of secrecy Togo
had moved southwards, that he would fall on his enemy
during the voyage across the Indian Ocean, or wait for
him in the China Sea. But the Japanese admiral had no
reason for embarking in such adventures. He knew that
if he kept his fleet near the shores of Japan his enemy
must come sooner or later within effective striking distance.</p>

<p>Rojdestvensky might attempt a raid on the coasts of
Japan, or make a dash for Niu-chwang to seize that port,
now the nearest base of supply of the Japanese field army.
Far-seeing precautions were taken against this eventuality
by accumulating enormous stores of supplies in the immediate
rear of the army. But it was far more likely that
the Russian admiral would try to reach Vladivostock, either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
with or without a battle. To do so he would have ultimately
to pass through one of three channels into the Sea of Japan.
He must choose between the Korean or Tsu-shima straits
between Japan and Korea, or the Tsugaru channel between
Nippon and Yozo, or the La P&eacute;rouse Straits (known to the
Japanese as the Soya channel) still further north. Whatever
course he chose, the best position for the Japanese
fleet was near the Tsu-shima straits, with the arsenal and
dockyard of Shimonoseki close by on the Japanese shore.
This the Russians themselves foresaw would be the most
likely position for Togo to select.</p>

<p>He made Masampho Bay on the Korean side of the
straits, and inside them (the "Douglas Bay" of our
Admiralty Charts), the station for his fleet. Freed from all
harassing blockading and cruising work, he devoted the
period between the retirement and destruction of the Port
Arthur fleet in the late summer of 1904, and the approach
of the Russians in May, 1905, to repairing his ships very
thoroughly, substituting new guns for those they had
mounted at the beginning of the war, which had had their
rifling worn down. Continual target practice and man&#0339;uvre
exercises kept every ship and every man up to the
mark. Charts of the sea around Japan were ruled off into
small numbered squares, so as to facilitate the reporting of
the enemy's position and movements from the moment he
would be first sighted. An elaborate system of scouting by
light cruisers was organized; signal stations were established
on islands and headlands, and wireless installations
erected at central and outlying points. If Rojdestvensky
made for the Tsu-shima channels, Togo was there to meet
him. If he went for either of the more northern straits, the
Japanese admiral counted on having news of his movements
in sufficient time to enable him to steam at full speed by a
shorter route, and still interpose between the Baltic
armada and Vladivostock.</p>

<p>After passing Singapore, on 25 March, there was another
delay before the final advance of the Russian fleet. Rojdestvensky
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
was anxious to give time to Nebogatoff to join
him. This last reinforcement was coming by the Mediterranean
route. The Russian commander-in-chief again
strained French neutrality to the utmost. In April and
May he passed week after week in the ports of French
Cochin China, first at Kamranh and then at Van Fong or
Honkohe. Here, early in May, he was at last joined by
Nebogatoff's squadron.</p>

<p>Again Japan protested against the use of French harbours
by her enemy. The diplomatic tension became acute, and
at one moment it seemed as if the Russian admiral were
anxious to produce complications that would force France
into the war. But at last, to the general relief, on 14 May
he sailed from Honkohe Bay. He passed through the
Bashi Strait between Formosa and the Philippines, and
then steered for Shanghai. Here, on 25 May, the fighting
portion of the fleet lay out at sea, while a crowd of auxiliary
steamers, colliers, store-ships, and armed merchantmen
were sent into the Wusung River, the mouth of the Yang-tse,
and anchored there.</p>

<p>Their appearance without the fleet to which they belonged
led to many conjectures. The Japanese at once
grasped its real meaning. To quote the message cabled by
the Tokio correspondent of "The Times":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They read it as a plain intimation that Rojdestvensky
intended to put his fate to the test at Tsu-shima, since,
had it been his purpose to make for Tsugaru or Soya, he
must have retained the services of these auxiliary ships
during several days longer. It is apparent, indeed, that
the Russian admiral here made his first cardinal mistake;
he should have kept his non-combatant vessels out of
sight as long as possible. Their absence from the arena
would have been a mysterious element, whereas their apparition,
especially as a segregated squadron in the Yang-tse
River, furnished an unerring clue to expert observers."</p></div>

<p>With the fleet the admiral retained only the hospital and
repairing ships and those laden with naval stores for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Vladivostock dockyard. On the evening of the 25th the
fleet stood out to sea heading for Tsu-shima. The weather
was bad, with a probability that it would be worse. There
was a rising wind and sea with cold rain that made a
blinding haze, but the Russian staff officers were rather
pleased than depressed at such unpleasant conditions.
Thick weather would baffle the Japanese scouts and lookout
stations, and rough seas would keep their torpedo
flotillas at anchor.</p>

<p>Out ahead were the fast cruisers of the scouting division,
the "Svietlana," "Almaz," and "Ural." After these
came the main body of the fleet in line ahead in two
columns, the heavy armour-clads on the starboard (right
side), the rest of the armoured ships and four cruisers in the
port line. Abreast of the leading ships each flank was
guarded by a cruiser and two torpedo destroyers. After
the fighting lines and between their foaming wakes steamed
four store-ships and two repairing ships. Last of all were
the two steamers fitted as hospital ships. The arrangement
is best shown by a rough diagram:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this order the great fleet steamed slowly through the
rain and darkness. On board the great battleships there
was much grumbling at "Nebogatoff's old tubs," though
they themselves could not do much better, for poor coal, inefficient
stoking, and weed-grown bottom-plates handicapped
even the newest of them. The next day, 26 May,
was the eve of the greatest naval battle in all history.
"The clouds began to break and the sun shone fitfully,"
says Captain Semenoff,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> "but although a fairly fresh
south-westerly wind had sprung up, a thick mist still lay
upon the water." Rojdestvensky meant to pass the
perilous straits in daylight, and he calculated that by noon
next day the fleet would be in the narrows of Tsu-shima.</p>

<p>Behind that portal of the Sea of Japan Togo was waiting
confidently for his enemy, who, he knew, must now be near
at hand. Never before had two such powerful fleets met
in battle, and the fate of the East hung upon the result of
their encounter.</p>

<p>That result must depend mainly upon the heavy armoured
ships. In these and in the number of guns of the
largest calibre, the Russians had an advantage so far as
mere figures went, as the following tables show:&mdash;</p>

<p>The annexed tables (pp. <a href="#Page_315">315</a>, <a href="#Page_316">316</a>) give some details of
Russian and Japanese armoured ships.</p>

<p>With regard to the armour it must be kept in mind for
purposes of comparison that the armoured belts of the
newer ships, nine inches at the thickest part, were of
Harveyized or Krupp steel, and could resist penetration
better than the thicker belts of the older ships. It
will be noticed that the Japanese carried fewer of the
heavier types of guns, but had more 6-inch quick-firers
than the Russians. This is a point to bear in mind in
following the story of the battle. It was the steady rain of
100-pounder shells from the quick-firers that paralysed the
fighting power of the Russian ships.</p>

<p>Far more important than the mere number of guns was
the fact that the Japanese shot straighter and had a more
effective projectile. There was such a marked difference
between the effect of the Japanese shells at Tsu-shima and
in the naval battle of 10 August, 1904, that Captain
Semenoff, who was present at both battles, thought that
in the interval the Japanese must have adopted a more
powerful kind of high explosive for their bursting charges.
This was not the case. Throughout the war the Japanese
used for their bursting charges the famous Chimose powder.
But perhaps between 10 August, 1904, and the following
May they had improved their fuses, so as to detonate the
charge more certainly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>The first five battleships on the Russian list were up-to-date
modern vessels. The "Navarin" was fairly fit to lie
in line with them. The rest were, to use a familiar expression,
"a scratch lot," coast-defence ships of small
speed and old craft quite out of date. The decks of the
larger ships were encumbered with an extra supply of coal,
and this must have seriously diminished their margin of
stability, with, as we shall see, disastrous results.</p>

<p>Admiral Togo could oppose to them only four modern
battleships. But his two heavy cruisers, the "Nisshin"
and "Kasuga" (the ships bought from Argentina on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
eve of the war), might almost have been classed as smaller
battleships, and certainly would have been given that
rank a few years earlier. His fine fleet of armoured cruisers
were at least a match for the Russian coast-defence ships
and the older battleships.</p>

<p>Besides his armoured ships, Admiral Rojdestvensky had
a squadron of six protected cruisers under Rear-Admiral
Enquist, whose flag flew in the "Oleg," a vessel of 6750
tons launched in 1903, and completed next year. She had
for her principal armament twelve six-inch quick-firers.
The other cruisers were the "Aurora," of a little over 6000
tons, the "Svietlana," of nearly 4000, the "Jemschug,"
and "Izumrud," of 3000 tons (these two armed with 47
quick-firing guns), and the "Almaz," of 3285, a "scout"
of good speed, carrying nothing heavier than 12-pounders.
There was one auxiliary cruiser, the "Ural,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> a flotilla of
nine destroyers, four transports, two repairing ships, and
two hospital steamers.</p>

<p>Awaiting the battle in sight of his own shores, Togo
had concentrated as auxiliary squadrons to his armoured
fleet a considerable number of protected cruisers and a
whole swarm of torpedo craft. At this stage of her naval
development, and on the eve of a life-and-death struggle,
Japan had no idea of "scrapping" even the older ships.
Anything that could carry a few good guns, and brave men
to fight them, might be useful, so even the old Chinese ironclad
which had carried Ting's flag at the Yalu battle, a
ship dating from 1882, was under steam in one of the
auxiliary squadrons, with four new 12-inch guns in her
barbettes.</p>

<p>There were three of these auxiliary squadrons, commanded
by Rear-Admiral Dewa, Rear-Admiral Uriu,
and Rear-Admiral Kataoka, the last having as a subordinate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
commander Rear-Admiral Togo, a relative of the
commander-in-chief. Dewa's flag flew in the "Kasagi,"
a fine cruiser of nearly 5000 tons, built in America, and he
had with him her sister ships, the "Chitose" and "Taka-sago."
Uriu's flag flew in the "Naniwa," Togo's ship when
he was a captain in the Chinese war. Several of the fine
cruisers which Ito had then led to victory were present,
many of them remodelled, and all provided with new guns.
Then there were a number of small protected cruisers, built
in Japanese dockyards since the Chinese war, the heralds of
the later time when the Japanese navy would all be home-built.
Battleships, armoured cruisers, and protected
cruisers were all swifter than the Russian ships. The fleet
as a whole could man&#0339;uvre at fully fifty per cent greater
speed than the enemy, and this meant that it could choose
its own position in battle.</p>

<p>The five torpedo squadrons included two or three
torpedo-gunboats, twenty-one fine destroyers, and some
eighty torpedo-boats. Togo's plans had the simplicity which
is a necessity in the rough game of war, where elaborate
schemes are likely to go wrong. Some of the swift protected
cruisers were scouting south of the straits. The
fleet was anchored in a body in Masampho Bay, and in
wireless communication with its scouts. The armoured
fleet was to make the main attack on the head of the
Russian advance. The protected cruiser squadrons were
to sweep round the enemy's flanks, fall upon his rear, and
destroy his transports and auxiliaries. The torpedo
flotilla was to be ready to dash in and complete the defeat
of the enemy when his fleet was crippled by the fight with
the heavy ships.</p>

<p>Most of the officers and men of the Russian fleet had the
dogged courage that could carry them through even a hopeless
fight, but they looked forward to the immediate future
with forebodings of disaster. Even among the officers on
board the great "Suvaroff" there was a feeling that the
most that could be hoped for was that a few ships would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
struggle through to Vladivostock, if there was a battle, and
that the best thing that could happen would be for the thick
weather and rough seas to enable them to avoid anything
like a close fight with the Japanese.</p>

<p>During the last day before the fight Rojdestvensky, who
did not want to hurry forward, but was timing his advance
so as to pass the straits in the middle of the next day, spent
some time in man&#0339;uvres. Captain Semenoff's notes on the
proceedings convey a useful lesson.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Once again" (he says), "and for the last time, we were
forcibly reminded of the old truism that a 'fleet' is created
by long practice at sea in time of peace (cruising, not
remaining in port), and that a collection of ships of various
types hastily collected, which have only learned to sail
together on the way to the theatre of operations, is no
fleet, but a chance concourse of vessels."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>Wireless telegraphy had come into use since the last
naval war, and a fleet could now try to overhear the aerial
messages of an enemy. In the Russian fleet the order had
been given that no wireless messages were to be sent. In
other words, the operators were to keep silence, and listen
by watching their apparatus. In the morning of the 26th
they thought they detected messages passing. In the
evening these were more frequent&mdash;"short messages of a
word or two" was the interpretation that the experts in
the signal cabins put upon the unintelligible flickerings of
the indicator, and they suggested that they were mere
negative code-signals from the Japanese scouts to their
main fleet, repeating an indication that they were on the
alert, and had seen nothing. This was mere guesswork,
however, and Politovsky's diary of the voyage<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> shows that
near the Cape, at Madagascar, and out in the midst of the
Indian Ocean, Rojdestvensky's wireless operators had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
thought that they detected Japanese aerial signalling,
simply because the receivers gave indications they could
not understand. Possibly these were merely the effect of
electric storms on the apparatus.</p>

<p>Once or twice, on 26 May, they thought they could read
fragments of sentences, such as&mdash;"Last night&mdash;nothing&mdash;eleven
lights&mdash;not in line." The short messages in the
evening came at fixed times. This showed that prearranged
signalling was really going on. It gave the impression that
perhaps the fleet was being watched by unseen enemies.</p>

<p>As the sun went down the ships closed up, and half the
officers were detailed for duty at the guns during the hours
of darkness. The rest lay down fully dressed, ready to turn
out at a moment's notice. Many slept on the decks. No
lights were shown. Semenoff's description of that night of
anxious expectation is worth quoting. He was on board
the flagship, the "Suvaroff":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The night came on dark. The mist seemed to grow
denser, and through it but few stars could be seen. On
the dark deck there prevailed a strained stillness, broken
at times only by the sighs of the sleepers, the steps of an
officer, or by an order given in an undertone. Near the
guns the motionless figures of their crews seemed like
dead, but all were wide awake, gazing keenly into the
darkness. Was not that the dark shadow of a torpedo-boat?
They listened attentively. Surely the throb of
her engines and the noise of steam would betray an invisible
foe. Stepping carefully, so as not to disturb the
sleepers, I went round the bridges and decks, and then
proceeded to the engine-room. For a moment the bright
light blinded me. Here life and movement were visible
on all sides. Men were nimbly running up and down
the ladders; there was a tinkling of bells and a buzzing of
voices. Orders were being transmitted loudly, but on
looking more intently, the tension and anxiety&mdash;that
same peculiar frame of mind so noticeable on deck&mdash;could
also be observed."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></div>

<p>At daybreak the Japanese scouts were in touch. As the
day came in grey light over the misty broken sea, one of
their scouts, the auxiliary cruiser "Siano Maru" (an armed
passenger liner), sweeping round through the haze, almost
collided with the hospital ships, and then dashed off and
disappeared in the twilight. In former wars she would
have had to run back to the fleet with her news. Now from
her wireless apparatus the information was sent through
the air to the receivers of the "Mikasa" in Masampho Bay,
and in a few minutes Togo knew that "the enemy's fleet
was in square No. 203 of the chart, apparently steering for
the eastern passage," i.e. the strait between Tsu-shima
Island and Japan.</p>

<p>In the straits and outside Masampho Bay a heavy sea
was running, and though the wind blew strongly from the
south-west, the weather was still hazy at sunrise, with
patches of fog here and there. The main body of the
Japanese fleet began to get up anchors and slip from its
moorings.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>At dawn Rojdestvensky had called in the "Almaz,"
leaving the "Jemschug" and "Izumrud" steaming in
advance of his two divisions. The six auxiliary ships had
closed up, so that the leading ship, the transport "Anadir,"
was abreast of the centre of the two lines. The "Almaz,"
"Svietlana," and "Ural," steamed at the rear of this
central line of transports, to protect them in that direction.
The two hospital ships, flying the Red Cross flag and
trusting to it for safety, were well astern. About 6 a.m.
the huge "Ural" came running up between the lines, and
semaphored to the flagship that four ships in line ahead
were passing across the rear of the fleet, but could not be
clearly made out in the mist.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>They could only be some of Togo's cruisers "shepherding"
the fleet. Just before seven a fine cruiser was seen
some five miles away on the starboard beam of the "Suvaroff."
She closed up to three miles, and was soon identified
as the "Idzumo." The big turret-guns were swung
round to bear on her, but the Japanese cruiser, having seen
what she wanted, increased her distance, but could be seen
still keeping the fleet in sight. Togo's report notes that at
7 a.m. the "Idzumo" sent by wireless the second definite
report of the enemy, stating that he was twenty-five miles
north-west of Ukushima, steering north-east. This would
make the Russian position about thirty miles south of
the Tsu-shima Islands, heading for the channel to the east
of them. An hour later, about 8 a.m., some Japanese ships
showed themselves the other side of the fleet. Semenoff
notes how:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The 'Chin-yen,' 'Matsushima,' 'Itsukushima,' and
'Hashidate,' appeared out of the mist, steaming on
an almost parallel course. Ahead of them was a small,
light cruiser, apparently the 'Akitsushu,' which hurriedly
drew off to the north as soon as we were able to see her
well (and equally she us), and the whole squadron began
slowly to increase their distance and gradually to disappear
from sight."</p></div>

<p>This was Vice-Admiral Takeomi's division, composed of
three of the cruisers that had fought at the Yalu battle,
eleven years before, and the "Chin-yen," which had
fought against them as the "Ting-yuen." The ship that
ran out ahead was the only quick or modern ship in the
squadron, the small Clyde-built armoured cruiser "Chiyoda."
If Rojdestvensky had had any speedy cruisers
available, he might have severely punished this slow
squadron of old ships. Takeomi showed he knew his enemy
by thus boldly approaching in the mist.</p>

<p>The Russians now realized that they had watchful
enemies all round them, and rightly conjectured that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
would find the enemy's heavy ships in the straits ready
for battle.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>At 10 a.m. another cruiser squadron appeared on the
port beam. This was Dewa's division, made up of the
American-built sister ships "Kasagi" and "Chitose," of
nearly 5000 tons, and two smaller protected cruisers, the
"Niitaka" and "Otowa," lately turned out by Japanese
yards. They seemed to invite attack. At a signal from
the admiral, the eight armour-clads of the starboard line
steamed ahead of the port line, turned together to port,
and then, turning again, formed line ahead, leading the
whole fleet. At the same time the transports moved out to
Starboard, guarded by the "Vladimir Monomach"
(detached from the port division), the "Svietlana,"
"Almaz," and "Ural."</p>

<p>Dewa's cruisers held a parallel course with the Russian
battleships for more than an hour, still apparently unsupported.
The range was about five miles. At 11.20
the Russians opened fire on them. Semenoff says that it
was the result of a mistake. "The 'Orel' fired an accidental
shot (which she immediately reported by semaphore).
Unable, with smokeless powder, to tell by which of the
leading ships it had been fired, the fleet took it as a signal
from the 'Suvaroff' and opened fire. Of the whole fleet
the fire of the 3rd Squadron was the heaviest."</p>

<p>This squadron was made up of Nebogatoff's "old tubs."
Their heavy fire was probably the result of undisciplined
excitement. The Japanese fired a few shots in reply, but
no harm was done on either side. Rojdestvensky, who had
kept the guns of his flagship silent, signalled "Ammunition
not to be wasted," and the firing ceased in five minutes,
just as the Japanese turned slowly and increased their
distance.</p>

<p>Orders were now signalled for the men of the Russian
fleet to have their dinners, and the officers lunched in turn.
The harmless skirmish encouraged some of the Russian
crews with the idea that they had been in action and were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
none the worse, and had driven the Japanese away. At
noon the fleet was due south of Tsu-shima, which towered
like a mountain out of the sea a few miles ahead. The
signal was hoisted, "Change course N.23&deg;E. for Vladivostock."
It was the anniversary of the Tsar's coronation.
Round the wardroom tables in his doomed fleet the officers
stood up and drank with enthusiasm to the Emperor, the
Empress, and "victory for Russia!"</p>

<p>The cheering had hardly died down when the bugles
sounded the alarm. Every one hurried to his post. The
enemy's cruisers had again shown themselves, this time
accompanied by a flotilla of destroyers, that came rolling
through the rough sea with the waves foaming over their
bows. On a signal from the admiral the four leading
battleships turned to starboard and stood towards the
enemy, then re-formed line ahead on a course parallel to
the rest of the fleet, and slightly in advance of it. The
Japanese on the threat of attack had turned also and
went off at high speed to the northwards.</p>

<p>At 1.20 p.m. the admiral signalled to the four next ships
of the fleet to join the line of battleships, forming astern of
them. The Russian armada was now well into the wide
eastern strait of Tsu-shima, and far ahead through the mist
a crowd of ships could be dimly seen. The crisis was near
at hand.</p>

<p>On receiving the first wireless message from the "Shinano
Maru" at daybreak, Togo had weighed anchor and come
out of Masampho Bay, with his main fleet steering east, so
as to pass just to the north of Tsu-shima. He had with
him his twelve armoured ships, and Rear-Admiral Uriu's
division of protected cruisers ("Naniwa," "Takachico,"
"Tsushima," and "Akashi"), and a strong flotilla of
destroyers. The smaller torpedo-boats, more than sixty
in number, had been already sent to shelter in Miura Bay
in the island of Tsu-shima, on account of the heavy seas.</p>

<p>During the morning Togo received a succession of wireless
messages from his cruisers, and every mile of the enemy's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
progress, every change in his formation was quickly signalled
to him. Shortly after noon he was able to note that
the Russians were entering the straits, steaming at about
12 knots on a north-easterly course; that they were
formed in two columns in line ahead, the starboard column
being the stronger, and that they had their transports
astern between the columns. He decided to attack them
on the weaker side at 2 p.m., when he calculated that they
would be near Okinoshima, a small island in the middle of
the eastern strait, about half-way between Tsu-shima and
the south-western headlands of Nippon.</p>

<p>At half-past one he was joined by Dewa's division of
cruisers, and a few minutes later the divisions of Kataoka
and the younger Togo rejoined. They had till now hung
on the flanks of the Russian advance. At a quarter to two
the enemy's fleet came in sight away to the south-westward
of Okinoshima. Flags fluttered up to the signal yards of
the "Mikasa," and the fleet read with enthusiasm Togo's
inspiring message:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>The rise or fall of the Empire depends upon to-day's
battle. Let every man do his utmost.</i>"</p></div>

<p>He had been about ten miles north of Okinoshima at noon
(by which time he had steamed some 90 miles from Douglas
Bay since 5 a.m.), thence he turned back slowly, going
west and a little south, till he sighted the Russians. He
crossed their line of advance diagonally at about 9500
yards distance. His light cruiser divisions had received
orders to steam southwards and attack the Russian rear,
and were already well on their way.</p>

<p>The heavy Japanese ships, circling on the left front of the
enemy's advance, put on speed, and were evidently intending
to recross the bows of the battleship division, bringing a
converging fire to bear on the leading ships&mdash;the man&#0339;uvre
known as "crossing the T." As the "Mikasa" led the
Japanese line on its turning movement Rojdestvensky
swung round to starboard and opened fire at 8500 yards.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Togo waited till the distance had shortened to 6500, and
then the guns of the "Mikasa" flashed out. At that
moment only three other of his ships had made the turn.
They also opened fire, and ship after ship as she came round
into line joined in the cannonade. The Russians turned
more slowly, and it was some time before the whole of their
line was in action. Meanwhile a storm of fire had burst
upon the leading ships of Rojdestvensky's lines, the
"Suvaroff" and the "Ossliabya" at the head of the
starboard and port divisions being each made a target by
several of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Japanese gunners were firing with a rapidity that
surprised even those who had been in the action of 10
August, and with much more terrible effect. In Captain
Semenoff's narrative of the fate of the "Suvaroff" we have
a remarkably detailed description of the execution done by
the Japanese shells in this first stage of the battle. The
opening shots went high. They flew over the "Suvaroff,"
some of the big 12-inch projectiles turning over and over
longitudinally in their flight. But at once Semenoff remarked
that the enemy were using a more sensitive fuse
than on 10 August. Every shell as it touched the water
exploded in a geyser of smoke and spray. As the Japanese
corrected the range shells began to explode on board or
immediately over the deck, and again there was proof of
the improved fusing. The slightest obstacle&mdash;the guy of
a funnel, the lift of a boat derrick&mdash;was enough to burst
the shell.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The first fair hit was on the side, abreast of the forward
funnel. It sent up a "gigantic column of smoke, water, and
flame." Then several men were killed and wounded near
the fore-bridge, and then there was a crash beside one of the
quick-firers, and, the shell bursting as it penetrated the deck,
set the ship on fire. In the battle of 10 August the flagship
"Tsarevitch," which had borne the brunt of the Japanese
fire, had been hit just nineteen times, but now that the
"Mikasa" and her consorts had got the range hit followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
hit on the leading Russian ships. "It seemed impossible,"
says Semenoff, "even to count the number of projectiles
striking us. I had not only never witnessed such a fire
before, but I had never imagined anything like it. Shells
seemed to be pouring upon us incessantly one after another....
The steel plates and superstructure on the upper deck
were torn to pieces, and the splinters caused many casualties.
Iron ladders were crumpled up into rings, and guns
were literally hurled from their mountings. Such havoc
would never be caused by the simple impact of a shell, still
less by that of its splinters. It could only be caused by the
force of the explosion.... In addition to this there was the
unusually high temperature and liquid flame of the explosion,
which seemed to spread over everything. I
actually watched a steel plate catch fire from a burst. Of
course, the steel did not burn, but the paint on it did. Such
almost incombustible materials as hammocks and rows of
boxes, drenched with water, flared up in a moment. At
times it was almost impossible to see anything with glasses,
owing to everything being so distorted with the quivering,
heated air. No! It was different to the 10th of August!"</p>

<p>In this storm of fire there was heavy loss of life. A shell-burst
killed and wounded most of the signallers as they
stood together at their station. An explosion against the
opening of the conning-tower killed two officers beside
Rojdestvensky, and slightly wounded the admiral. The
fight had not lasted more than twenty minutes, and the
"Suvaroff," the "Alexander," and "Borodino," the
three leading Russian ships, were all wrapped in black
smoke from the fires lighted on board of them by the
Chimose shells.</p>

<p>How was the Japanese line faring? I talked over his
battle experiences with a Japanese officer not long after
the day of Tsu-shima. He told me his impression was
that at first the Russians shot fairly well, causing some loss
of life at the more exposed stations on board the leading
Japanese ships. "But," he added, "after the first twenty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
minutes they seemed suddenly to go all to pieces, and their
shooting became wild and almost harmless." No wonder
that under such a tornado of explosions, death and destruction,
and with their ships ablaze, and range-finding and fire-controlling
stations wrecked, the gunnery of the Russians
broke down. One of the pithy sayings of the American
Admiral Farragut was: "The best protection against the
enemy's fire is the steady fire of your own guns." Tsu-shima
gave startling proof of it.</p>

<p>Semenoff hoped that the Japanese were also suffering
from the stress of battle. From the fore-bridge of the
"Suvaroff" he scanned their line with his glasses. In the
sea-fights of other wars both fleets were wrapped in a dense
fog of powder smoke, but now with the new powder there
was no smoke except that of bursting shells and burning
material. So he could distinguish everything plainly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The enemy had finished turning. His twelve ships
were in perfect order at close intervals, steaming parallel to
us, but gradually forging ahead. No disorder was noticeable.
It seemed to me that with my Zeiss glasses (the
distance was a little more than two miles) I could distinguish
the mantlets of hammocks on the bridges and
the groups of men. But with us? I looked round. What
havoc! Burning bridges, smouldering d&eacute;bris on the
decks, piles of dead bodies. Signalling and judging distance
stations, gun-directing positions, all were destroyed. And
astern of us the 'Alexander' and the 'Borodino' were
also wrapped in smoke."</p></div>

<p>Men were killed in the turrets by shell splinters flying
through the narrow gun openings. The fire hose was
repeatedly cut to ribbons, and the men fighting the fire
killed. The injuries caused by near explosions were terrible.
Men were literally blown to atoms, or limbs were torn off.
Eleven wooden boats piled up on the spar-deck were a
mass of roaring flame. Gun after gun was disabled. And
all the while a glance at the Japanese fleet showed them
steaming and firing as if at peace man&#0339;uvres, without even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
one of their numerous flagstaffs and signal yards shot away.
The battle had not lasted an hour, and it was already
evident that it could have only one ending.</p>

<p>In the smoke and confusion Semenoff could only see what
was happening in the front of the line, but the other ships
were exposed to a heavy fire, and had less resisting power.
The "Ossliabya," the fifth of the battleships, and F&ouml;lkersham's
flagship during the voyage,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> was the first to succumb.
The firing had hardly begun when a 12-inch projectile
penetrated her forward above the water-line. In fine
weather the effect would not have been very serious, but
the heavy sea flooded her two bow compartments. Then
another shell started an armour plate on the water-line
amidships, flooded the bunkers on the port side, and gave
her a heavy list in that direction. Unsuccessful attempts
were made to right her by opening valves and admitting
water on the other side. Then a shell burst in the fore-turret
and put all the crews of the two guns out of action.
She was now settling down by the head and heeling over
more and more to port. Suddenly the sea reached her
lower gun-ports and poured into her. Then, like the unfortunate
"Victoria," she "turned turtle," and sank. It
was at 2.25 that she disappeared thus suddenly, the first
battleship ever sunk by gun-fire. Three of the destroyers
picked up some of the crew who had jumped overboard.</p>

<p>As she sank, the three other ships of her division
("Sissoi," "Navarin," and "Nakhimoff"), under the
stress of the Japanese fire, sheered for a while out of the line
with their upper works ablaze in several places. The four
stately battleships at the head of the line had then to face
the concentrated attack of the enemy. The "Orel" was
suffering like her consorts. Though her armour was nowhere
penetrated, the shells burst their way into her unarmoured
superstructure, and reduced everything on her
upper decks to tangled wreckage. Five minutes after the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
"Ossliabya" sank a shell wrecked the after-turret of the
"Suvaroff," tearing the after-bridge to pieces with the
flying fragments. Her steering gear was temporarily
disabled, and she drifted from her station at the head of
the line. One by one in quick succession the heavy steel
masts and two huge funnels crashed down. The upper
deck was impassable from end to end. In the midst of the
confused wreckage handfuls of brave men fought the fires
with buckets as they broke out now here now there. Most
of the guns were silent. "She no longer looked like a ship,"
says a Japanese account.</p>

<p>When the "Suvaroff" swerved out of the line at a few
minutes before three o'clock her steering gear had been
disabled, and probably for a few minutes before the crisis
she had not been answering her helm. The course of the
fleet, while she led it during the fight with the Japanese
armoured fleet, had been due east, but, as she lost her
direction, it turned slightly to the south. When she drifted
away from the line the "Imperator Alexander&nbsp;III" became
the leading ship. Captain Buchvostoff, who commanded
her, led the fleet in a circle round the disabled
"Suvaroff," first running southwards, increasing the
distance from the enemy, and then sweeping round as if
trying to break through to the northward. Togo followed
on a parallel course until the Russian fleet seemed to be
going due south, then he signalled an order, and, as accurately
as if they were performing a practice evolution at
man&#0339;uvres, his twelve ships turned simultaneously
through half a circle, thus reversing the direction and
changing the order of the fleet so that the last ship in the
line became the leader. As the Russians swept round to
the north Togo was thus ready to cross their bows, and the
"Alexander" received the concentrated fire of several
ships.</p>

<p>She turned eastwards, followed by her consorts in a
straggling line, and then drifted out of her place at the
head of it, leaking badly, and with her upper works ablaze.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
On a smoother sea the "Tsarevitch" had been hit once
below the armour belt on 10 August.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>The "Borodino" now had the dangerous post at the
head of the line. It steamed eastwards for nearly an hour,
followed by Togo on a parallel course, the Japanese fire
only slackening when fog and smoke obscured its targets,
and the fire of the Russians dwindling minute by minute,
as gun position after position became untenable or guns
were disabled and dismounted.</p>

<p>Long before this the divisions of protected cruisers under
Admiral Dewa and his colleagues had worked round to the
southward of the Russians. Dewa and Uriu, with their
swift ships, were in action by a quarter to three. The slower
ships of Takeomi and the younger Togo's squadrons,
united under the command of Rear-Admiral Kataoka, came
into the fight a little later. In the heavy sea that was
running the light cruisers afforded a less steady platform
for the guns than the big armoured ships, and their fire was
not so terribly destructive. But it was effective enough, and
that of the Russian rear ships was hopelessly bad. The
Japanese cruisers drove the transports and their escort, in
a huddled crowd, north-eastwards towards the main Russian
fleet. The great wall sides of the German liner, now the
auxiliary cruiser "Ural," were riddled, and the giant
began to settle down in the water. The cruiser "Svietlana,"
hit badly in the forepart, was dangerously down by the
head. The transports "Kamschatka" and "Irtish" were
both set on fire, and the latter was also pierced along
the water-line. She sank at four o'clock. The "Oleg" and
"Aurora" were both badly damaged. But the Japanese
unarmoured cruisers did not escape scathless. Dewa's
fine cruiser, the "Kasagi," was badly hit below the waterline,
and was in such danger of sinking that he handed the
command of his squadron over to Uriu and, escorted by
the "Chitose," steamed out of the fight, steering for the
Japanese coast. Togo's old ship, the famous "Naniwa
Kan," was also hit below the water-line, and had to cease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
firing and devote all the energy of the crew to saving the
ship.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the Russian fleet, battleships, cruisers, and
transports, were huddled together in a confused crowd,
attacked from the eastward by Togo and Kamimura with
the heavy squadrons, while from the south the line of light
cruisers under Uriu and Kataoka poured a cross-fire into
them. Away to the westward lay the disabled and burning
"Suvaroff" with the Russian naval flag, the blue cross of
St. Andrew on a white ground, still flying from a flagstaff
in the smoke. The admiral had been twice wounded, the
second blow slightly fracturing his skull, and making it
difficult for him to speak. Her captain, Ignazius, had been
simply blown to pieces by a Japanese shell while, after
being already twice wounded, he was directing a desperate
effort to master the conflagration on board. The decks
were strewn with dead, the mess-deck full of helpless
wounded men. Most of the guns were out of action, but a
6-inch quick-firer and a few lighter guns were kept in
action, and drove off the first attempt of the Japanese
destroyers to dash in and sink her. Still there was no
thought of surrender. The few survivors of her crew
fought with dogged Russian courage to the last. A torpedo
destroyer, the "Buiny," taking terrible risks, came up to
her, hung on for a few moments to her shattered side, and
succeeded in getting off the wounded admiral and a few
officers and men. Rojdestvensky sent a last message to
Nebogatoff, telling him to take over the command and try
to get through with some part of the fleet to Vladivostock.</p>

<p>About half-past five some of the Russian ships struggled
out of the press, led by the burning "Borodino," with the
"Orel" next to her. In the straggling line battleships and
cruisers, armoured and unarmoured, were mingled together.
The "Alexander" had succeeded in stopping
some of her leaks and had rejoined the line. She was near
the end of it. The "Ural," deserted by her crew, was drifting,
till one of Togo's battleships sank her with a few shots.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>
<p>The Russians were now steering northwards, and for the
moment there was no large ship in front of them. The
Japanese could have easily headed them off, but Togo now
regarded them as a huntsman regards a herd of deer that
he is driving before him. The Japanese squadron steamed
after them at reduced speed, just keeping at convenient
range, the heavy ships on their right, the light squadrons
behind them. At first the armoured ships concentrated
their fire on the "Alexander." Shells were bursting all
over her, and throwing up geysers of water about her bows.
Then the merciless fire was turned on the "Borodino."
A few minutes after seven the "Alexander" was seen to
capsize and disappear. A quarter of an hour later there
was an explosion on board of the "Borodino." Next
moment a patch of foam on the waves showed where she
had been. About the same time a division of torpedo-boats
came upon the unfortunate "Suvaroff," torpedoed her,
and saved some of the crew, who were found floating on the
water after she sank.</p>

<p>As the sun went down, and the twilight darkened into
night, the firing died away. What was left of the Russian
fleet was steaming slowly into the Sea of Japan, some of
the ships isolated, others holding together in improvised
divisions, all bearing terrible marks of the fight, some of
them still on fire, others leaking badly.</p>

<p>Togo had been hit during the fight, but it was only a
slight bruise. The losses of his fleet had been trifling. Of
the armoured ships the only one that had been badly hit
was the "Asama." She was struck by three shells aft near
the water-line, her rudder was disabled, and she was leaking
badly. She left the fighting-line for a while, but was able
temporarily to repair damages, and rejoined later in the
day.</p>

<p>At sunset Togo ordered his squadrons to steam north-eastward
during the night, and unite at sunrise at a point
south of Matsu-shima or Ullondo Island. They were to
keep away from the Russian ships in the darkness. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
victorious admiral was about to let loose his torpedo
flotillas, to complete the destruction of the flying enemy,
and meant that his torpedo officers should have no anxiety
about hitting friends in the dark.</p>

<p>He had with the main fleet twenty-one destroyers
organized in five squadrons. In the bays of Tsu-shima
nearly eighty torpedo-boats had been sheltering all day.
The destroyers had been directed to pursue and attack the
beaten enemy during the night. No orders had been given
to the torpedo-boats. The sea was going down, but it was
still rough, and Togo had doubts about risking the smaller
craft. But without orders, sixteen groups of four boats
each, sixty-four in all, got up steam and sallied out into
the darkness.</p>

<p>It was an awful night for the Russians. After dark they
had extinguished the fires lighted by the enemy's shells,
and in some cases got collision mats over the leaks. The
dead were committed to the sea, the wounded collected and
cared for. For more than an hour they were allowed to
hold their course uninterrupted, and the lights of the
Japanese fleet were disappearing far astern. After all,
Vladivostock might be reached. But just after eight
o'clock the throb of engines, the hurtling beat of propellers,
came sounding through the night from all sides.
On the sea black, low objects were rushing along with
foaming phosphorescent wakes trailing behind them.
Bugles ran out the alarm; crews rushed to quarters;
searchlights blazed out, and the small quick-firers that
were still serviceable mingled their sharp ringing reports
with the crackle of machine-gun fire. The sea seemed to
be swarming with torpedo craft. They appeared and disappeared
in the beams of the searchlights, and the surface
of the water was marked with the long white ripples raised
by the rush of discharged torpedoes. Loud explosions, now
here now there, told that some of them had found their
target, though in the confusion and the rough sea there
were more misses than hits. The "Sissoi Veliki," which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
had been on fire in the action, and pierced below the waterline,
had a new and more serious leak torn open in her
stern, the rudder was damaged and two propeller blades
torn off. But she floated till next day. Several ships received
minor injuries, but kept afloat with one or more
compartments flooded. But the effect of the attack was
to disperse the fugitive Russians in all directions.</p>

<p>When it began Nebogatoff was at the head of a line of
ships in the old battleship "Imperator Nikolai&nbsp;I." In the
confusion only three of the line kept up with him, the
much-battered "Orel" and the "Admiral Apraxin" and
"Admiral Senyavin." The "Orel" had no searchlight
left intact. The "Nikolai" and the two others did not
switch on their searchlights, and kept all other lights
shaded. The remarkable result was that as they moved
northwards through the darkness they were never attacked,
though more than once between 8 p.m. and midnight
they saw the enemy's torpedo craft rushing past
them. The ships with searchlights drew all the attacks.</p>

<p>Admiral Enquist, with his flag in the "Oleg," and
followed by the "Aurora" and "Jemschug," had run in
amongst the remains of the transport flotilla at the first
alarm, narrowly escaping collision with them. Then he
turned south, in the hope of shaking the enemy off, but
came upon another flotilla arriving from that direction.
He had some narrow escapes. The look-outs of the "Oleg"
counted seventeen torpedoes that just missed the ship.
Having got away, he tried more than once to turn back to
the northward, but each time he ran in among hostile
torpedo-boats, and saw that beyond them were ships with
searchlights working and guns in action, so he steered
again south. At last he gave up the attempt and headed
for the Tsu-shima Straits. He got safely through them,
because the main Japanese fleet was miles away, steaming
steadily north, with tired men sleeping by the guns. Next
day he was in the open sea with no enemy in sight, and set
his course for Shanghai.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>
<p>At midnight the defeated Russians thought they had at
last shaken off the pursuit of the sea-wolves. But at
2 a.m. the attacks began again. The "Navarin" and the
"Admiral Nakhimoff," among the rearmost ships, were
attacked by Commander Suzuki's squadron of destroyers.
The "Navarin" was sunk after being hit by two torpedoes.
The "Nakhimoff" was severely damaged. About the
same time the "Vladimir Monomach" and the "Dimitri
Donskoi" were torpedoed, but managed to keep afloat.
The attacking force had a good many casualties. Torpedo-boats
Nos. 35 and 65 were sunk by the Russian fire. Their
crews were rescued by their consorts. Four destroyers (the
"Harusami," "Akatsuki," "Izazuchi," and "Yugiri")
and two torpedo-boats (Nos. 31 and 68) were so seriously
damaged by hostile fire, or by collision in the darkness,
that they were put out of action. As the dawn began to
whiten the eastern sky the torpedo flotillas drew off.</p>

<p>At sunrise the Russian fleet was scattered far over the
Sea of Japan. Some of the ships for a while steamed alone
with neither consort nor enemy in sight within the circle of
the horizon. But new dangers came with the day. Togo's
fleet was at hand, flinging out a wide net of which the
meshes were squadrons and detached cruisers to sweep the
sea northwards, and gather up the remnants of the defeated
enemy. The weather was clearing up, and it was a fine,
bright day&mdash;just the day for the work the Japanese had
to do.</p>

<p>Steaming steadily through the night, Togo, with the main
body of the Japanese fleet, had passed to eastward of the
scattered Russians, and was about twenty miles south of
Ullondo. The distances covered in this battle of Tsu-shima
were beyond any that had ever been known in naval war.
The running fight during the night had passed over more
than 150 miles of sea. At 5.20 a.m. the admiral on board
the "Mikasa" received a wireless message from Kataoka's
cruisers, reporting that they were sixty miles away to the
southward of him, and that they could see several columns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
of black smoke on the horizon to the eastward. Shortly
after Kataoka sent another wireless message&mdash;"Four of the
enemy's battleships and two cruisers are in sight, steering
north-west." Togo at once signalled to his own ships to
head off this detachment of the enemy, and sent wireless
orders to Kataoka and Uriu to close in on their rear. It
was probably the main fighting division left to the Russians,
and would soon be surrounded by an overwhelming
Japanese force.</p>

<p>The ships sighted by the cruisers were those that Admiral
Nebogatoff had led through the night, and was trying to
take to Vladivostock. He had with him the battleships
"Nikolai&nbsp;I" and "Orel," the coast-defence armour-clads
"Admiral Apraxin" and "Admiral Senyavin," and the
cruisers "Izumrud" and "Svietlana." This last ship was
leaking badly and down by the bows. She could not keep
up with the others, and at daylight fell far astern and lost
sight of them. At 7 a.m. Uriu's division in chase of Nebogatoff
came up with her, and the cruisers "Niitaka" and
"Otowa" were detached to capture her. The Russian
captain, Schein, had held a council with his officers. He
had only a hundred shells left in the magazines, and the
"Svietlana" was being kept afloat by her steam pumps.
Under the regulations he could have honourably surrendered
to a superior force, but it was unanimously resolved to fight
to the last shot, and then sink with colours flying. The
fight lasted an hour. There were heavy losses. The
Japanese fire riddled the ship, and first the starboard, then
the port engine was disabled. As the hundredth shot rang
out from the "Svietlana's" guns, Captain Schein stopped
the pumps and opened the sea-cocks, and the ship settled
down rapidly in the water. The Japanese cruisers went off
to join the fleet as the "Svietlana" disappeared, but an
armed Japanese liner, the "America Maru," stood by and
picked up about a hundred men.</p>

<p>At 10.30 a.m. Nebogatoff was completely surrounded
eighteen miles south of the island of Takeshima. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
"Izumrud" had used her superior speed to get away to
the south-west. The four battered ships that remained
with him saw more than twenty enemies appear from all
points of the compass, including Togo's battleships and
heavy armoured cruisers, all as fit for work as when the
first fighting began. They opened fire at long range with
their heavy guns.</p>

<p>The situation was desperate. Nebogatoff consulted his
officers, and all those on board the "Nikolai" agreed that
he must surrender. In a memorandum he subsequently
wrote he pointed out that, though some ammunition was
left, the Japanese were using their superior speed to keep
a distance at which he could not reply effectively to their
overwhelming fire; neither the shore nor other ships were
within reach; most of the boats had been shattered, the
rest could not be lowered; even the life-belts had been
burned or used to improvise defences in the ships; continued
resistance or the act of sinking the ships would only
mean the useless sacrifice of some 2000 men. After the
ships had been only a short time in action, during which
time they received further severe damage, he hauled down
his colours. Togo allowed the Russian officers to retain
their swords, as a proof of his opinion that they had acted
as befitted brave and honourable men.</p>

<p>While the brief action with Nebogatoff's squadron was in
progress, the third of the Russian coast-defence battleships,
the "Admiral Ushakoff," hove in sight. She turned off to
the westward pursued by the armoured cruisers "Iwate"
and "Yakumo." They soon overhauled her, and signalled
a summons to surrender, adding that Nebogatoff had
already done so. The "Ushakoff" replied with her 9-inch
guns. The cruisers sank her in an hour, and then rescued
some three-fourths of her crew of 400 men.</p>

<p>The "Sissoi Veliki," badly injured in the action of the
day before, and torpedoed during the night, was in a sinking
condition when the sun rose on 28 May. No ships were in
sight, all the boats had been destroyed, and while the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
pumps were still kept going the crew was set to work to
construct rafts. While this was being done with very
scanty materials, the "Vladimir Monomach" hove in sight,
accompanied by the destroyer "Iromki." In reply to a
signal for help, the "Monomach" answered that she could
do nothing, as she was herself expecting to sink soon. The
"Iromki" offered to take a few men, but the captain of the
"Sissoi" generously refused to deprive the "Monomach"
of her help. The two ships then steamed away. An hour
later the "Sissoi" was just settling down in the water,
when three Japanese armed merchant steamers appeared
and took off her crew. At half-past ten the "Sissoi"
heeled over to starboard and sank.</p>

<p>Soon after she lost sight of the "Sissoi," the "Monomach"
came upon the armoured cruiser "Admiral Nakhimoff,"
which also signalled that she was in a sinking condition.
Presently there was smoke on the horizon, and
then the armed steamer "Sadu Maru" and the Japanese
destroyer "Shiranui" appeared. In such conditions the
enemy proved a friend. The crews of the two unfortunate
ships were transferred to the "Sadu," which stood by till,
about ten o'clock, both the "Nakhimoff" and the "Monomach"
went to the bottom.</p>

<p>The "Navarin" was comparatively little injured in the
battle, but was torpedoed during the night. Leaking
badly, she struggled northward at a slow rate till two in the
afternoon of the 28th, when she was found and attacked
by a Japanese destroyer flotilla. She still made a fight with
her lighter guns, and was hit by two torpedoes. The crew
were all at their battle stations when she began suddenly
to sink. The order, "All hands on deck," came too late,
and very few lives were saved.</p>

<p>The armoured cruiser "Dimitri Donskoi," last survivor
of Rojdestvensky's fourteen battleships and armoured
cruisers, escaped the torpedo attacks in the night, and
eluded pursuit all through the morning of the 28th. At
4 p.m., when she was near the island of Ullondo, she sighted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
some Japanese ships in the distance, Uriu's cruiser
division and some destroyers. They closed slowly on her,
and it was not till six o'clock that she was attacked by the
cruisers "Niitaka" and "Otowa," and three destroyers.
The "Donskoi" made a gallant fight for two hours,
beating off the torpedo-boats, losing sixty killed and twice
as many wounded, and finally disengaging herself in the
darkness about eight o'clock. The water-line armour was
intact, but one boiler was penetrated and ammunition was
nearly exhausted. In the night, the captain, who was
himself slightly wounded, decided to land his men on
Ullondo Island and sink the ship. All the boats had been
shattered and the cutter that was left had to be hastily repaired
before it could be lowered. With the one boat the
disembarkation went on slowly during the night. At dawn
the enemy's torpedo-boats were sighted. The rest of the
crew jumped overboard and swam ashore, leaving a few
men with the second-in-command on the ship. They ran
the "Donskoi" out into a hundred fathoms of water,
opened the sea-cocks, embarked in their one boat, and
saw their ship go down as they pulled ashore. The
Japanese sent a couple of steamers to take the crew off the
island.</p>

<p>The torpedo destroyer that conveyed the wounded
Admiral Rojdestvensky, Captain Semenoff, and a few other
officers and men away from the fight was found and captured
by a Japanese flotilla during the afternoon of the 28th.</p>

<p>The cruiser "Izumrud," one of the few fast ships the
Russians had with them, escaped the torpedo attacks in the
night. In the morning she was chased by several of the
enemy's cruisers. She kept up a good speed, and one by
one they abandoned the chase, the "Chitose" being the
last to give it up. By 2 p.m. all pursuit was left behind, and
she reduced speed. In the battle and the chase she had
burned so much coal that she had not enough left to make
for Vladivostock, so she steered for Vladimir Bay, in the
Russian Coast Province of Siberia, north of Korea. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
was off the entrance of the Bay at midnight with only ten
tons of coal left in her bunkers. Unfortunately, in trying to
go in in the dark on the flood-tide she drove hard on a reef.
Next day unsuccessful efforts were made to get his ship off
and in the afternoon, as her captain expected the enemy's
ships might arrive to secure the "Izumrud" and refloat
her, he landed his crew on Russian ground, destroyed his
guns one by one with blasting charges, and then blew up
the ship.</p>

<p>The destroyer "Groki" was chased and captured by the
Japanese destroyer "Shiranui" and a torpedo-boat, and
after a sharp fight close to Tsu-shima Island surrendered
at 11.30 a.m. She was so injured that she sank within an
hour of her capture. Admiral Enquist, with the three protected
cruisers "Oleg," "Aurora," and "Jemschug," had,
after turning south for the last time during the night of
torpedo attacks, got through the Tsu-shima Straits in the
darkness. Next day no enemy was in sight, and he steered
for Shanghai under easy steam, repairing damages on the
way. He intended to lie off the port, bring a couple of
colliers out of the Woosung River, fill his bunkers at sea,
and try to reach Vladivostock by the Pacific and the La
P&eacute;rouse Straits. On the morning of the 29th he was overtaken
by the repairing ship and tug "<span class="ins" title="Swir">Svir</span>," and from her
learned the full extent of the disaster. Fearing that if he
approached Shanghai he would be driven into the port and
blockaded by the enemy, he changed his course for Manila,
where he arrived on 3 June. The "<span class="ins" title="Swir">Svir</span>," after communicating
with him, had gone on to the Woosung River. She
was joined on her way there by the transport "Anadir,"
which had got successfully south through the Tsu-shima
Straits. The transport "Korea," which had escaped in the
same way, and had a cargo of coal, did not go to Woosung,
but crossed the Indian Ocean and appeared unexpectedly
in the French port of Diego Suarez in Madagascar. Of the
nine torpedo destroyers with the Russian fleet seven were
hunted down and sunk or taken by the Japanese.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>
<p>The only ships of all the Russian armada that finally
reached Vladivostock were the two destroyers "Brawy"
and "Gresny," and the small swift cruiser "Almaz." She
had been with Enquist's cruiser division in the first hours
of the night after the battle. During the torpedo attacks
she had become separated from her consorts. Escaping
from the destroyers, she headed at full speed first towards
the coast of Japan, then northward. At sunrise on the 28th
she was well on her way and many miles north-east of
Togo's fleet. Next day she reached Vladivostock with
160 tons of coal still on board.</p>

<p>A hundred years after Trafalgar Togo had won a
victory as complete and as decisive. The Russian power
had been swept from the Eastern Seas, and the grey-haired
admiral who had secured this triumph for his native land&mdash;"Father
Togo," as the Japanese affectionately call him&mdash;had
lived through the whole evolution of the Imperial
Navy, had shared in its first successes, and for years had
been training it for the great struggle that was to decide
who was to be master in the seas of the Far East.</p>

<p>The war was followed by an immediate expansion of the
Japanese Navy. Numbers of captured Russian ships were
repaired, re-armed, and placed in the Navy List under
Japanese names. No longer dependent on foreign builders,
the Japanese yards were kept busy turning out yet a new
navy of every class, from the battleship to the torpedo-boat.
The laying down of the gigantic "Aki" and "Satsuma,"
battleships of over 20,000 tons, opened a new
period in naval construction, and nations began to count
their sea-power by the number of "Dreadnoughts" afloat
or on the slips.</p>

<p>The great maritime powers are now engaged in a race of
construction, and the next naval war will see forces in
action far surpassing even the armadas that met at Tsu-shima.
And maritime war, hitherto confined to the surface
of the sea, will have strange auxiliaries in the submarine
stealing beneath it, and the airship and aeroplane scouting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
in the upper air. But still, whatever new appliances, whatever
means of mutual destruction science supplies, the
lesson taught by the story of all naval war will remain true.
Victory will depend not on elaborate mechanical structures
and appliances, but on the men, and will be the reward of
long training, iron discipline, calm, enduring courage, and
the leadership that can inspire confidence, command self-sacrificing
obedience, divine an enemy's plans, and decide
swiftly and resolutely on the way in which they are to be
frustrated.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Some interesting light was thrown upon the voyages of the Norsemen
by a practical experiment made in 1893. A Viking ship was built
on the precise lines and dimensions of the ancient ship dug out of the
mound of Gokstadt in 1880, 77 feet long with a beam of 17 feet, and was
rigged with one mast and a square mainsail and jib foresail. As a prelude
to her being shown at the Chicago Exhibition she was successfully taken
across the Atlantic under sail and without an escorting ship. She left
Bergen on May 1st, 1893, and arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, U.S.A.,
on June 13th. She was commanded by Captain Magnus Andersen, who
in 1886 had performed the feat of crossing the Atlantic in an open boat.
Andersen had a crew of eleven men in the Viking ship. He reported that
she had met with some bad weather and proved an excellent sea boat.
Her average speed was nine knots, but with a fair wind she did eleven.
In the following year the ship was accidentally sunk in the Chicago river,
and raised and broken up.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Admiral Jurien de la Gravi&egrave;re in his study of the campaign of
Lepanto remarks that many a fortified strait has owed its inviolability only
to its exaggerated reputation for the strength of its defences, and adds that
in the Greek war of independence a French sailing corvette, the "Echo,"
easily fought its way into the gulf past the batteries, and repassed them
again when coming out a few days later.</p></div>

to the first years of the nineteenth century, but the only sailors who ever
ventured to take galleys into the wild weather of the Atlantic were the
Norse Vikings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> These old wooden ships had a much longer life than the steel battleship
of to-day, which becomes obsolete and is broken up after twenty
years. The "Ark," launched in 1587 (and built at the cost of
&pound;5000&nbsp;=&nbsp;&pound;50,000 in the money of to-day), was refitted and renamed the "Anne
Royal" (after James&nbsp;I's queen) in 1608; was the flagship of the Cadiz
expedition of 1625, and was broken up in 1636. Hawkins's ship, the
"Victory," was launched in 1561; she sailed as the "Resolution" in Blake's
fleet under the Commonwealth; was renamed the "Royal Prince" at the
Restoration, and was burned in 1666 during Charles&nbsp;II's Dutch war. She
was then over a hundred years old and still fit "to lie in the line of
battle."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Macaulay, writing his ballad of the Armada before the full English
and Spanish records of the time were available, represents the news as
being brought to Plymouth by a merchantman that had seen "Castille's
black fleet lie heaving many a mile" out by the Channel Islands, where
the Armada was never sighted. The "tall 'Pinta'" chased her for hours.
There was no such ship in the Armada. Macaulay took the name of one
of Columbus's caravels to adorn his ballad. Instead of the enemy seeing
"fire and smokes" at dawn, he describes with more picturesque effect,
how, in the night&mdash;

cruisers which were disarmed in a neutral port after the battle of August
10th, 1904. He then returned to Europe, was attached to the staff of the
Baltic fleet, and went out to the East on board the flagship. His remarkable
narrative, "The Battle of Tsu-shima," is a vivid detailed account of
the "Suvaroff's" fortunes during the fight. He died in 1910.</p></div>

in which the battle took place is really about as wide as the North Sea between
Harwich and the Hook of Holland. (See accompanying <a href="#plan17">sketch map</a>.)</p></div>
